Even if one believes that the tension can be alleviated, the scholarly consensus is that Mill's self-professed commitments to hedonism, utilitarianism, and liberalism cause a variety of necessary frictions in his work, and that the Mill of Utilitarianism and the Mill of On Liberty  are clearly strange bedfellows. In this dissertation, I provide a systematic reading of Mill's ethical, moral, and liberal doctrines that dissolves the apparent paradoxes of Mill's practical philosophy. I argue that Mill was a hedonist and a utilitarian in name only; he endorsed a Grecian-Romantic conception of happiness and defended a moral theory that enjoins us, not to maximize utility, but to avoid harm. Subsequently, I contend that Mill's liberal theory is just the social/political expression of his moral theory: the Mill of Utilitarianism and the Mill of On Liberty are not only reconcilable but practically identical to one another. In addition, I distinguish between Mill's concepts of  liberty and freedom and argue that Mill advances a republican theory of freedom as non-domination. For Mill, as long as we enjoy freedom with breadth (i.e., the right range of liberty) and depth (i.e., security against arbitrary power), we are, as he says in On Liberty, "completely free."2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Politics0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1093365440uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp018c97kt21w02761nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002200164245008300186260005800269300001100327500008000338502004800418506006900466520164400535710004502179773005302224793001202277856015002289856005602439AAI1093678120190610161709.5190610s2018    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866478  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10936781  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12767  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aDolganov, Anna G.10aEmpire of Law: Legal Culture and Imperial Rule in the Roman Province of Egypt. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2018  a539 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2018.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis dissertation seeks to shed light on the administration of justice in the provinces of the Roman empire, arguably the most prominent public interface between the Empire and its subjects, as well as the sphere in which Rome left its most far-reaching and lasting legacy in the Mediterranean world. In order to do so, this study integrates, for the first time, the voluminous and underexploited evidence of documentary papyri from Roman Egypt into a broader investigation of judicial administration in the Roman provinces, from its origins under the Republic to the threshold of late Antiquity at the end of the third century CE. This study examines the sphere of law and courts in the Roman empire from several perspectives: first, by considering the institutional framework within which Roman courts administered justice to provincials, then by considering the significance of Roman record-keeping and archival institutions for the imperial legal order, then by examining how Roman provincial courts dealt with local laws and traditions. Finally, the study examines the agency of legal practitioners in the development of the Roman imperial legal sphere, as well as the significance of the adoption of distinctly Roman models of legal culture by civic elites in Roman Egypt and elsewhere in the Roman empire. By systematically bringing the rich papyrological material from Egypt to bear on broader questions of law and legal culture in the Roman provinces, this dissertation seeks to open new horizons for the study of Roman legal history and to develop new perspectives on the institutional and cultural impact of Roman imperial rule.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Classics0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1093678140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp014m90dz29k03613nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002100164245008500185260005800270300001100328500008000339502004800419520065100467520076801118520081101886520028502697710007002982773005303052793001203105856015003117856005603267AAI1097676320190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866546  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10976763  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12808  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aTakahashi, Saki.10aLandscapes of Immunity: From Epidemiological Applications to Ecological Drivers. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a162 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aInfectious diseases present unique scientific challenges that are also of huge societal importance; in particular, control measures are strengthened by a better understanding of transmission dynamics. Despite much research, there are still considerable knowledge gaps regarding the ecological and evolutionary interactions between pathogens and host immunity, across scales ranging from the molecular to the global. The over-arching theme of this dissertation is clarifying 'landscapes of immunity' -- or, who's protected from infection and who isn't -- with a focus on the two acute viral pathogen systems of measles and non-polio enteroviruses.  aFor measles, the availability of a safe and effective vaccine has led to the disease being a target for global elimination. However, measles continues to circulate in many countries and remains one of the leading killers of children globally. This is due to the efficiency with which the pathogen spreads, necessitating high levels of population immunity to interrupt transmission. Here, we develop models to identify spatial heterogeneities in susceptibility to measles, examining the interplay between epidemiology, demography, and geography (Chapter 1). We also deploy statistical methods to characterize the health system repercussions of the recent West African Ebola crisis, on increased susceptibility to measles and other childhood infections (Chapter 2).  aThe well-characterized epidemiology and transmission dynamics of measles has laid the foundational framework to study the epidemic clockwork of other childhood infections. In particular, the non-polio enteroviruses are a group of relatively recently emerged pathogens (close relatives of the polioviruses) that have been implicated in large outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease among children in the Asia-Pacific region. Here, we elucidate key epidemiological parameters for two of the causative enterovirus serotypes, and explore ecological drivers of their disease dynamics using mechanistic transmission models. We link the modeling to incidence time series data from China (Chapter 3) and from Japan (Chapter 4), and characterize the extent to which observed epidemic patterns may be predictable.  aOverall, this dissertation aims to elucidate landscapes of immunity through case studies, with relevance for guiding public health policy on vaccine-preventable diseases as well as for gaining novel insights into the biological mechanisms shaping multi-serotype pathogen dynamics.2 aPrinceton University.b Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1097676340uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp010v838335803360nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002300164245004600187260005800233300001100291500008000302502004800382520027500430520060500705520068901310520075401999710004602753773005302799793001202852856015002864856005603014AAI1097737020190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866553  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10977370  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12813  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aCramer, Judd N.

A common theme among these articles is that changes in technology and institutions can have impacts on the functioning of the labor market and innovation.  aChapter 1 explores an understudied question in innovation: what is the relative importance of patent term (i.e., duration of patent protection) across different industries? This article (co-authored with fellow Princeton Ph.D., Neel Sukhatme) measures term sensitivity through patent applicants' response to the passage of the TRIPS agreement, which changed how term was calculated. We find significant differences in term sensitivity across industries, some of which follows conventional wisdom (patent term is important in pharmaceuticals) and some of which does not (it also matters for software).  aChapter 2 investigates whether the emergence of ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft lowered the wages and employment of taxi drivers and chauffeurs. To evaluate the impact of ride-sharing services, this paper uses the timing of the rollout of Uber along with the company's degree of popularity across cities to estimate the effects of competition from Uber on taxi and limousine drivers' employment and wages. In contrast to the literature on disruptions in other industries, including the deregulation of the trucking and airline industries in the 1970s, I find no evidence that the advent of Uber has had a negative impact on wages in the taxi and limousine industry thus far.  aChapter 3 documents that it was the behavior of the record number of long-term unemployed during and after the Great Recession that explained the initial movements away from the Beveridge curve, which puzzled economists. I extend the calibrated model originally estimated in Krueger, Cramer, and Cho (2014) and focus on the channels through which duration dependence could be a factor. Incorporating the cyclical patterns in the labor force flows of the long-term unemployed (lower labor force withdrawal rates during recessions and higher labor force withdrawal rates as recoveries continue) improved the accuracy of the model's forecast of the unemployment rate and produced the counterclockwise loops as predicted in Blanchard and Diamond (1989).2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Economics0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1097737040uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01w3763955703047nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100003300164245006800197260005800265300001100323500008000334502004800414506006900462520192500531710005402456773005302510793001202563856015002575856005602725AAI1097851420190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866560  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10978514  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12817  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aPerez-Ramirez, Cesar Arturo.10aInsights into the Regulation of Cellular Phosphate Homeostasis. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a144 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThe inositol polyphosphates (InsPs) are a unique class of signaling molecules that have been implicated in the promotion of tumor growth and metastasis. In yeast and plants, the InsPs have been recognized as regulators of phosphate homeostasis. In mammalian systems however, the regulatory role of InsPs in metabolic networks has not been addressed. Although little is known about the molecular mechanisms controlling phosphate metabolism in humans, there is evidence linking phosphate availability to cancer progression. Investigating the role of phosphate in cancer metabolism and its modulation by InsPs can therefore provide a fundamental understanding of tumor cell requirements. Combining metabolomic and chemical biology approaches, we characterized the metabolic response of cancer cells to changes in phosphate availability and interrogated the modulation of these responses by InsPs. By investigating the metabolomic profiles of cells grown under phosphate deprivation, we observed a direct effect on nucleotide biosynthesis and one-carbon metabolism, as evidenced by the accumulation of purine intermediates and the impairment of serine carbon incorporation. We then applied chemically synthesized affinity reagents that led to the identification of AMP deaminase and GMP reductase as interaction partners of the small molecule messenger 5-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (5PP-InsP5). Additional experiments showed that genetic deletion of the enzymes responsible for the production of 5PP-InsP5, the inositol hexakisphosphate kinases, phenocopied the metabolic effects observed under conditions of phosphate starvation. Data presented in this thesis provides a clear link between InsPs, purine biosynthesis, and phosphate homeostasis. Our long term goal is to fully annotate phosphate-dependent metabolic pathways and elucidate their potential implications in energy expenditure, cancer, and development.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Molecular Biology0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1097851440uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01rb68xf63503470nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002500164245008700189260005800276300001100334500008000345502004800425506006900473520079300542520086601335520064902201710005902850773005302909793001202962856015002974856005603124AAI1097856120190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866577  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10978561  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12818  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aYousef, Aia Hussein.10aCredible Impostures: Translation and Prose Fiction in the Long Eighteenth Century. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a205 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis dissertation explores the relation between translation and prose fiction in the long eighteenth century. I make multiple claims, but my primary one is straightforward: I argue that a concept of the credible fiction comes into sharper focus in the eighteenth century in large part because of writers who turn to contemporaneous translation discourse for ideas about producing an "imitation" of the world in their fictions. In historicizing the term "imitation," I draw attention to both the distinctive ways that translators and imitators during this period theorized their practice and how these ideas and techniques were absorbed and further developed by writers of fiction who were, themselves, interested in producing something like copies of the world around them in their texts.  aThe title of my dissertation, Credible Impostures: Translation and Prose Fiction in the Long Eighteenth Century, also refers to the significance of the word "imposture" to my study. In one way or another, all of the fictions under examination in this dissertation draw from the centuries-old Western Christian discourse on "Mahometanism." While Western representations of Islam are part of a broad and shifting semantic field that extends over centuries, they become overwhelmingly associated with the concept of imposture beginning in the seventeenth century. Part of my study, then, relies on the argument that fictions staged in or that draw from representations associated with some part of the Islamic world emerge as crucial ground for the conjunction of several ideas that are vital to this study: ideas related to credibility, simulation, and credulity.  aMy first chapter turns to translation's theorization in the long eighteenth century, and the following three chapters situate the literary works of Daniel Defoe, Montesquieu, Penelope Aubin, James Ridley, Frances Sheridan, Horace Walpole, Clara Reeve, and others in a historical context that demonstrates the crucial overlap of ideas about translation and fiction during this period. Through close readings of these "fictions of translation"---both pseudotranslations and fictions that I argue thematize translation---I propose a reexamination of the role that ideas and practices of translation play in the development of the credible fiction.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Comparative Literature0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1097856140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01mk61rk72k03449nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002000164245010400184260005800288300001100346500008000357502004800437520086600485520057101351520042501922520046902347710007202816773005302888793001202941856015002953856005603103AAI1097863420190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866584  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10978634  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12819  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aChristie, Dane.14aThe Spatial Distribution of Local Glass Transition Temperatures in Nanostructured Block Copolymers. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a192 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-06(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis dissertation demonstrates the use of fluorescence labeling and spectroscopy as a characterization tool which provides component- and location-specific measurements of the glass transition temperature (Tg), a fundamental polymer property, in a model nanostructured diblock copolymer---a polymer chain comprised of two chemically dissimilar homopolymers bound by a single covalent bond. Nanostructured diblock copolymers are self-assembled periodic materials with domains rich in either block, confined by the domain interface. The parameters governing the domain Tg---namely, the bulk T g of the homopolymers, the domain period, and the degree of segmental mixing between the blocks---can be systematically varied by choosing the block chemistries and total chain length. This combination of features offers a wide parameter space for property optimization.  aUntil now, no characterization tool has demonstrated the capability of providing spatially-resolved Tg measurements across the domain structure, information that is crucial for optimizing the end-use properties. The length scales associated with the domain period, O(10--100 nm), pose a significant barrier towards performing such measurements. Here, this barrier was overcome by selectively incorporating a fluorescent monomer into the diblock copolymer chain during synthesis, thereby controlling the location where Tg was measured in the self-assembled structure.  aIn diblock copolymers of poly(n-butyl methacrylate- b-methyl methacrylate), PBMA-PMMA, which self-assemble into a lamellar morphology, a strong gradient in Tg of the higher-Tg PMMA block---42 K over 4 nm---was mapped with nanometer resolution. These measurements also revealed a strongly asymmetric influence of the domain interface on Tg, with a much smaller dynamic gradient being observed for the lower-Tg PBMA block.  aTg was characterized for a series of fluorescently-labeled homopolymers dilutely blended into an unlabeled diblock copolymer matrix. Unlike in the neat diblock copolymer, the labeled PMMA chains were not attached to the domain interface. A comparison of the Tg depression of the homopolymers in the blends to equivalent labeled diblock copolymers reveal ~ 5 K and 10 K contributions due to nanoscale confinement and block attachment to the interface, respectively.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-06B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1097863440uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01gx41mm63v03678nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002600164245004900190260005800239300001100297500008000308500004600388502004800434520056400482520063601046520074201682520025202424520034402676710007303020773005303093793001203146856015003158856005603308AAI1097898120190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866607  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10978981  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12820  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aLandgren, Peter Chal.10aDistributed Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a134 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aIncludes supplementary digital materials.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aSocial decision-making is a common feature of both natural and artificial systems.

Such tasks are inherently subject to the explore-exploit tradeoff, where one must select between options with the highest expected payoffs based on current knowledge (exploitation) and options with less well-known but potentially better outcomes (exploration).  aIn this thesis, we consider distributed social decision-making under uncertainty. Specifically, we develop and utilize the multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem to model and study how multiple interacting agents make decisions that balance the explore-exploit tradeoff. we consider several different communication protocols for sharing information between agents. We develop and analyze algorithms that address the multi-agent MAB problem under each protocol. We derive bounds on performance and use the bounds to analyze the influence of network structure, i.e., who is communicating with whom, on decision-making outcomes.  aWe first consider communication through consensus, and derive novel results concerning the performance of cooperative estimation of expected reward. We then use these results to develop, analyze, and prove performance bounds for several algorithms that address the multi-agent MAB problem both with and without constraints on concurrent sampling of arms by multiple agents. Furthermore, we develop a new graph centrality measure, which we call "explore-exploit" centrality, that can be used to predict performance of networked agents in an MAB problem with communication through consensus. We demonstrate the utility of this centrality measure, and the performance of the algorithms through numerical simulations and robotic experiments.  aNext, we consider the multi-agent MAB problem with strictly local communication, and develop a novel partition-based algorithm that uses imitation to improve performance. We analyze this algorithm through performance bounds and simulation results.  aFinally, we consider application to robotic search for radioactive material in a facility. The search for radioactive material is an inherently noisy process, and can be modeled as an MAB problem. We develop and test a MAB-based algorithmic solution and demonstrate that it enables a robot to find multiple radioactive sources efficiently.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1097898140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01c534fr72c04461nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001800164245010000182260005800282300001100340500008000351502004800431520147400479520084501953520084602798520019703644710005903841773005303900793001203953856015003965856005604115AAI1097937720190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866614  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10979377  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12821  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aLee, Wei-Han.10aUser Authentication and Security Vulnerabilities Using Smartphone Sensors and Machine Learning. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a174 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThe ubiquity of mobile devices such as smartphones and wearable devices together with their ever-growing computing, networking, and sensing powers have been increasingly changing the landscape of our daily lives. These devices are often equipped with various embedded sensors including GPS, camera, microphone, environmental sensors (e.g., ambient light sensor and barometer), and motion sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, and rotation sensor). There have been countless advances in effectively utilizing these sensors to improve the convenience of smartphone users. With the increasing development of embedded sensors in smartphones, the risks of leaking users' sensitive information through exploring these sensors have raised privacy and security concerns. Furthermore, an increasing amount of private and sensitive information is stored in our smartphones. For instance, 92:8% of Android smartphone users store private information in their smartphones. At the same time, smartphones have also become personal computing platforms for users to access private cloud services, e.g., e-banking and online social networks. This makes smartphones very attractive targets for attackers to get access to personal and valuable information. In this thesis, we aim to 1) improve mobile security by developing advanced user authentication systems through utilizing mobile sensors; 2) discover new vulnerabilities of the innocuous motion sensors embedded in mobile devices.  aUser authentication is essential to thwart the privacy, confidentiality and integrity breaches possible through attacks on smartphones. Current login mechanisms use explicit authentication, which requires users' participation, e.g., passwords and fingerprints. However, repeated explicit authentications are not convenient for users and the system does not automatically authenticate the user again after the user passes the initial authentication. This creates significant risks for adversaries to take control of the users' smartphones, after the legitimate users' initial login. To protect smartphones from adversaries who masquerade as legitimate users, we propose secure re-authentication systems that exploit the embedded sensors of smartphones to achieve accurate authentication performance implicitly, efficiently, and continuously.  aWithin the built-in sensors of mobile devices, some require users' permissions to obtain access because these sensors are explicitly utilized for collecting the users' sensitive information. However, motion sensors, such as the accelerometer, gyroscope and rotation sensor, do not require users' permissions, probably due to the assumption that data collected by these sensors are not sensitive. However, even motion sensors that do not require explicit permissions are still vulnerable to privacy attacks since their measurements are closely correlated with users' sensitive behavior patterns. We propose an attack to explore the feasibility of inferring users' inputs on the smartphone touchscreen using sensor data collected from motion sensors based on the observed correlations between the user inputs and the motions of the smartphone.  aOverall, this work analyzes various aspects of authentication and security vulnerabilities of smartphone sensors, in order to discover new opportunities and challenges for smartphone security.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Electrical Engineering0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1097937740uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp017d278w80t02125nam a2200253   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001800164245008000182260005800262300001100320500008000331502004800411520107100459710007001530773005301600793001201653856015001665856005601815AAI1097966320190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866621  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10979663  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12822  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aGutin, Maria.14aThe Genetics of Morphological Evolution in Silkworms (Bombycidae:  Bombyx). 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a150 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aUnderstanding the evolution and underlying genetic mechanism of morphological adaptations has been an ongoing aim of evolutionary biology. Morphological evolution can occur as a species-specific adaptation and function in reproductive isolation. Despite investigation into the traits themselves, the genetic basis of interspecific morphological traits is poorly understood outside of domesticated plants and vertebrates. In my dissertation work, I combine high-throughput genotyping techniques and differential expression/allele-specific expression analyses to investigate the genetics of morphological evolution in the sister-species  Bombyx mandarina and Bombyx mori. My work provides new insights on the genetic architecture of two morphological trait differences between B. mori and B. mandarina, caudal horn length and wing pigmentation. My work also illustrates the utility of combining high-throughput genotyping techniques for genetic mapping and gene expression analysis to hone in on a small number of candidate genes underlying phenotypic trait evolution.2 aPrinceton University.b Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1097966340uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp013n204187d03339nam a2200277   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002600164245006900190260005800259300001100317500008000328502004800408506006900456520101700525520120401542710004402746773005302790793001202843856015002855856005603005AAI1097999220190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866638  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10979992  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12823  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aBraun, Daniel Rafael.10aKinds of Wrong: The Liberalization of Modern Poetry 1910 - 1960. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a371 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aWhat does it mean for a poet go wrong? What does it mean that criticism is no longer able to pose, let alone take an interest, in the formulation of this question? My dissertation offers a history of modern poetry and its criticism, taken as a single institution, by tracing a shift in our senses of wrong, from something unequivocal, to something supple and complex, requiring elaboration, explanation, compromise, further discussion, and the agreement to disagree. I call this transformation a process of liberalization, by which I mean a set of changes at once epistemological, moral, and political, and of which the domains of poetry and criticism form an advance guard. Across the work of Ezra Pound, Wallace Stevens, W.H. Auden, and Frank O'Hara, and in the criticism of I.A. Richards, and T.S. Eliot, I show how it was modernism that first taught us to subtilize our senses of wrong, to approach questions of evaluation as matters of interpretation, and to think of understanding as a form of forgiveness.  aPoets were once freely criticized for grammatical, factual, stylistic, moral, theological, and political mistakes. I show how such criticisms are, over the course of the 20th century, displaced by questions as to what might count, in the first place, as a poet's mistake per se. Individual chapters examine a variety of conflicts, external and internal, from Ezra Pound's early blunders of translation and the limits of scholarly responsibility and poetic license, to the political incorrectness of Wallace Stevens' poetry of the 1930s, and his entanglement with the literary Left, and W.H. Auden's guilty conscience about the freedoms he demanded a postwar democratic society extend to its poets. The dissertation culminates in a novel account of the Bollingen controversy, in which I argue that partisans and critics of Liberal democracy alike came to stake the very survival of its institutions on an appreciation of Pound's incorrigibility, and the incorrigibility of the figure of the poet in general. It is in the wake of this controversy that the questions of aesthetic wrong and fault give way to an ethos of toleration, and give shape to a concept of poetry as a form of expressive freedom.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of English0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1097999240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01zw12z807t03355nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002400164245005700188260005800245300001100303500008000314502004800394506006900442520222500511710008202736773005302818793001202871856015002883856005603033AAI1098012420190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866645  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10980124  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12824  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aNunez, Sophia Blea.10aBodies and Books in the Early Modern Hispanic World. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a302 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aBodies and Books in the Early Modern Hispanic World  studies books -- cuerpos de libros -- and human bodies in parallel to yield new insights into both book culture and the struggles to construct identity as legible on the body. I take metaphors of books as bodies seriously, amid the elevated stakes of the early modern Hispanic world's preoccupations with genealogy, legitimacy, and blood purity. I suggest that books were conceptualized as bodies in the early modern Hispanic world and that this was significant in part because wishful thinking of the period treated human bodies as books that ought to be legible, reliable markers of identity. This project deliberately close reads both literary and documentary, verse and prose, manuscript and print, canonical and lesser-known texts for what they reveal about books and bodies -- namely, where the understanding and treatment of them was intertwined, and where it diverged. Because the equation of books and bodies was so pervasive yet broken, I study its uses and abuses from both sides: books as bodies and bodies as books. The trajectory of this project arcs from cuerpos de libros to human bodies. First, I articulate the conceptual and practical connections between books and human bodies through analysis of the multifarious comparisons found in early modern literature, poetic theory, writing manuals, and moralistic works. Next, I turn to the theory and practice of libraries as sites where books and bodies interact, focusing on the Biblioteca Colombina, gathered by Columbus's son Hernando Colon, and the Escorial library, founded by Philip II. To examine issues of cultural patrimony, materiality, access, and the value of books and bodies, I follow the saga of Arabic manuscripts captured from Morocco in 1612, incorporated into the Escorial, and digitally repatriated in 2013. Finally, I turn to body writing, the converse of books as bodies. Centered on the convent-fleeing conquistador Catalina/Antonio de Erauso and the mixed-race surgeon and ex-slave Elena/o de Cespedes, my third section discusses the foibles of reading and writing ambiguous bodies and how concepts of racial and religious difference invoked culturally-specific ideas of gender.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Cultures0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1098012440uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01v405sd15p03212nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002500164245014100189260005800330300001100388500008000399500004600479502004800525520053500573520053001108520039101638520053802029710007202567773005302639793001202692856015002704856005602854AAI1098016120190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866652  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10980161  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12825  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aScoullos, Emanuel V.10aSurface Chemistry of Model Oxygenates on Nickel and Platinum Single Crystals for Bio-Oil Upgrading and Synthesis of Renewable Chemicals. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a190 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aIncludes supplementary digital materials.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThe adsorption and reaction of three prominent bio-oil compounds were investigated on Ni(110), Sn/Ni(110), and Pt(100) single crystal surfaces using temperature programmed desorption (TPD), infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These bio-oil compounds; acetic acid (CH3COOH), furfural (CH3OCHO), and guaiacol (C6H4(OH)(OCH3)) were chosen because of their prevalence in bio-oils, varied functional groups, and difficulty in upgrading via catalytic hydrodeoxygenation.  aAcetic acid adsorption and decomposition was studied on Ni(110), Sn/Ni(110), and Pt(100) single crystal surfaces. On each surface, the acetic acid dissociatively adsorbs, forming an acetate species that decomposes upon further heating leading to desorption of H2, CO, CO2 or water. On Ni(110) and Sn/Ni(110), autocatatlytic decomposition of the acetate occurred after high initial coverages of acetic acid, which did not occur on Pt(100). DFT calculations support the presence of a bidentate acetate species at all coverages.  aAt high initial coverages, furfural adsorbs in a tilted configuration on Pt(100). Furfural dissociatively adsorbs forming two bonds with the surface through the ring oxygen and aldehyde carbon in a tilted configuration. This configuration undergoes decarbonylation forming furan and CO. Further decomposition of furan led to formation of propylene, additional H2, CO and surface carbon.  aGuaiacol adsorption and decomposition was studied on Pt(100). At high initial coverages, guaiacol was also found to adsorb in a tilted configuration in IRAS. DFT calculations for high coverages of guaiacol also confirm this species. The OH bond in guaiacol is the first to break, followed by unselective decomposition of the functional groups, which eventually desorb as H 2, CO, CH4, and CH2O. Benzene, small amounts of phenol were also produced. Ring dehydrogenation reactions ultimately led to production of H2 and surface carbon.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1098016140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01qb98mj25t03611nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002900164245006400193260005800257300001100315500008000326502004800406506006900454520021800523520074000741520079601481520071602277710004502993773005303038793001203091856015003103856005603253AAI1098055220190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866669  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10980552  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12826  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aFifield, Benjamin Haber.10aEmpirical and Computational Methods for Electoral Politics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a128 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis collection of three essays introduces new computational and empirical methods for data analysis and validation in political science, with specific applications to the practice and study of electoral politics.  aIn the first chapter, I introduce a set of graphical diagnostics that can be used to improve statistical models of heterogeneous treatment effects. I adapt the uplift curve, which has been used previously to visualize cumulative benefits from targeting treatments, and repurpose it as a tool for model selection to make model-building workflows for predicting treatment effects less ad-hoc. I also present a stack-ranking graphical diagnostic for heterogeneous treatment effect models to help visualize model fit, and I apply both diagnostics to a canonical experiment on voter mobilization using social pressure appeals. The chapter advances a more principled model-building approach for predicting individual-level treatment effects.  aThe second chapter builds on recent computational and simulation-based methods for studying the effects and consequences of congressional redistricting. As ensembles of simulated redistricting plans become more common in the academic literature and as legal evidence, validating the accuracy and representativeness of those algorithms has become increasingly important. This paper makes two advances --- first, it applies a recently-developed enumeration algorithm to increase the size and complexity of simulation validation datasets, and second, it introduces a new validation diagnostic that can be used to ensure redistricting simulators are accurately representing the target distribution of plans. I then apply the new validation test to two competing redistricting simulation methods.  aThe third chapter (adapted from work coauthored with Ted Enamorado and Kosuke Imai) is a practical guide to data merging and record linkage using fastLink, a new open-source implementation of the canonical Fellegi-Sunter probabilistic record linkage model. I briefly review fastLink and the computational improvements it implements, and I then walk through several applied data examples using the software that illustrate its preprocessing, merging, and inspection functionalities. Finally, I apply the entire proposed workflow and software to a validation exercise using data on local-level politicians in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where I use fastLink to analyze rates of party switching across election cycles.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Politics0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1098055240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01kp78gk16302852nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002600164245009900190260005800289300001100347500008000358502004800438506006900486520027400555520042200829520049601251520047701747710005502224773005302279793001202332856015002344856005602494AAI1098061520190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866676  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10980615  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12827  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aGren, Magnus Ribbing.14aThe Lineage Orientation and Its Critics Paths to Pluralism in Chinese Classicism and Politics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a319 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThroughout the late imperial period, conflict and disunity in Chinese politics were tied to a lack of consensus in classical scholarship. As the civil examinations grew in importance, intellectual partisanship and political factionalism became inextricably intertwined.  aGenerations of Chinese scholars during the Song-Yuan-Ming-Qing dynasties recognized this problem and many sought a solution, while some Late Ming intellectuals resigned to individualism and relativism. Partly in reaction to such Late Ming trends, Qing dynasty scholarship developed methods and techniques that used textual evidence to forge indisputable consensus in the reading and interpretation of classical texts.  aQing evidential research in Canton was at its nineteenth century peak when scholars like Fang Dongshu (1772-1851) and Chen Li (1810-1882) began to question it. They declared the movement's attempt to establish intellectual consensus a failure and viewed the exclusivist values of its methodology as the cause of that failure. They also traced this exclusionism back to Cheng-Zhu  daoxue in the Song-Ming dynasties and argued that it was being perpetuated in Qing dynasty evidential research.  aThis dissertation systematizes these exclusivist values under the label of a "lineage orientation" in Chinese classicism and politics. It then demonstrates how nineteenth century Chinese scholars countered the lineage orientation with methodological innovation in the pursuit of variations on the concept of pluralism. The notion of pluralism, as a solution to disunity and partisanship, was then further developed by Gu Jiegang (1893-1980) and others in Republican China.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of East Asian Studies0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1098061540uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01fx719q26503482nam a2200277   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002200164245006600186260005800252300001100310500008000321502004800401506006900449520083400518520153501352710004602887773005302933793001202986856015002998856005603148AAI1098097020190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866683  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10980970  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12828  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aMonroe, Christin.10aNatural and Non-natural Reactivity of Heme-Thiolate Proteins. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a278 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-06(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis thesis describes the isolation and characterization of a novel and highly expressed heme-thiolate peroxygenase, MroAPO, from the fungus  Marasmius rotula ATCC 76396. Sequence analyses and catalysis studies have shown MroAPO to be distinctive from its European counterpart from  Marasmius rotula DSM 25031. Both MroAPO from M. rotula ATCC 76395 and DSM 25031, like AaeAPO from Agrocybe aegerita, share the ability to catalyze P450-like monooxygenation of various organic compounds, requiring only hydrogen peroxide as a co-substrate. In this dissertation ATCC 76395 MroAPO is preliminarily characterized and unique cyclopropanation and N-H insertion reactions are characterized for both ATCC 76395 MroAPO and other heme proteins including chloroperoxidase from Caldariomyces fumago  and synthetic de novo heme-bound peptides.  aIn chapter 1, the reactivity and mechanism of heme-thiolate enzymes is reviewed, along with comparisons of APO, CPO and CYP enzymes. A summary of recombinant production of APO enzymes is also provided. In chapter 2, ATCC 76395 MroAPO is characterized and compared to DSM 25031 MroAPO. The protein from ATCC 76395 was cultivated and isolated from the fungal medium and was found to be a heme-thiolate peroxygenase similar to MroAPO from the DSM 25031 strain. Mass spectrometry revealed a number of point mutations, including a phenylalanine to tyrosine mutation adjacent to the heme and near the active site of the protein. The reactivities of ATCC 76395 MroAPO with various oxidants are compared and the mutations between ATCC 76395 MroAPO and DSM 25031 are discussed. Chapter 3 is focused on the reactivities of ATCC 76395 MroAPO, alkaline CPO, microperoxidase-11 and de novo heme-bound synthetic proteins for cyclopropanation and N-H insertion. It was found that alkaline CPO surpassed both natural and engineered heme proteins with > 99% efficiency for aniline N-H insertion conversion. Chapter 4 is an examination of UV-Vis, stopped-flow and EPR spectroscopies to isolate and characterize the active intermediate involved in N-H insertion reactions with alkaline CPO. It was found that styrene cyclopropanation and N-H insertion appear to proceed through different active intermediates. Finally, chapter 5 reports various attempts to produce novel APO proteins using wild type fungi and various recombinant cellular factories.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Chemistry0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-06B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1098097040uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01b5644v33c03218nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002300164245013500187260005800322300001100380500008000391502004800471520060800519520047001127520040601597520060802003710004602611773005302657793001202710856015002722856005602872AAI1098120420190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866690  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10981204  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12829  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aPark, James Eujin.10aPhotoelectrochemical Fuel Production on Delafossite AgRhO 2 and AgFeO2 and Electrochemical Oxidative Etching of Sn-doped Bi2Te2Se. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a154 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aCorrelating electrochemical and photoelectrochemical behaviors to the materials properties is an important aspect to provide basic understanding in diverse scientific fields that employ (photo)electrochemistry. Among different fields, solar fuel generation is a fascinating method to utilize solar energy to produce fuels, thus alleviating potential energy shortage and concerns on climate change. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the detailed mechanisms for heterogeneous charge transfer processes (CO2 and H2O reduction) and the effect of the catalysts' chemical and physical properties.  aInspired by previously reported CuRhO2 and CuFeO2 from the Bocarsly and Cava groups, AgRhO2 and AgFeO2 were prepared and examined for their photocatalytic activities. AgRhO 2 photocathode was shown to be photocatalytically active for H 2 generation with great photostability. However, AgFeO2 did not possess a suitable conduction band edge position, only providing &sim;130 mV of overpotential for H2 generation and not sufficient for CO 2 reduction to formic acid.  aThe correlation between chemical compositions and photocatalytic activities was examined by comparing AgFeO2, AgRhO2, CuFeO 2, and CuRhO2. It was rationalized that Ag+ (instead of Cu+) in the A-site of the delafossite structure (ABO2) reduces the kinetic barrier for H2 generation, and Fe3+ (instead of Rh 3+) in the B-site provides a better catalytic surface for both H2 generation and CO2 reduction.  aIn this thesis, the effect on bulk properties and topological surface states of topological insulators against electrochemical oxidation was also investigated. With potential usage in spintronics and quantum computing, this should be well-understood for future device applications. The electrochemical treatment resulted in triangular etch pits on the surface, but the bulk properties and topological surface states were unaffected. This proved that electrochemical oxidation is a potential method for altering the surface morphology while maintaining the bulk properties and topological surface states.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Chemistry0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1098120440uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp016d570040q03240nam a2200277   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002600164245009600190260005800286300001100344500008000355502004800435506006900483520117800552520089001730710007102620773005302691793001202744856015002756856005602906AAI1098243420190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866706  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10982434  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12830  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aVollgraff, Matthew H.14aThe Science of Expression: Ausdruckskunde and Bodily Knowledge in German Modernist Culture. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a453 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aFrom the late 1870s to the early 1930s, an interdisciplinary field named Ausdruckskunde flourished throughout German-speaking Europe. Its proponents analyzed the expressive movements of both human and nonhuman bodies as a medium of nondiscursive knowledge---whether psychological, aesthetic, historical, or all at once. Until now the full interdisciplinary scope of this "science of expression" has largely escaped scholarly notice; yet as this dissertation argues, the long-neglected history of  Ausdruckskunde has profound implications for the way we understand the interrelations of art and science in German modernity. The spread of evolutionary anthropology, physiological aesthetics and new media technologies during this turbulent period exacerbated the problematic status of somatic expression, a phenomenon which then as now directly challenges oppositions between inner and outer, mind and matter, individual and social, and natural and artificial.  Ausdruckskunde arose in response to these virulent uncertainties, proposing a heterogenous epistemology of bodily gesture that unsettled more established ways of knowing in both the natural and the human sciences.  aOver eight chapters examining the work of figures like Charles Darwin, Wilhelm Wundt, August Schmarsow, Aby Warburg, Ludwig Klages, Sergei Eisenstein, Max Scheler and Helmuth Plessner, I demonstrate how the "terra incognita" of expressive movement provoked a number of unprecedented close encounters and collaborations between far-flung methods and practices. The more they tried to resolve the problem of expression, I argue, the more these artists, scientists and scholars were compelled to displace the logic of individual sciences and produce new connections between them. Transgressing disciplinary boundaries in the pursuit of a more labile bodily knowledge, the itinerant science of expression remapped the relationships between nature and culture, art and language, memory and history, and human and nonhuman life in ways that have become more pertinent today than ever before.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Germanic Languages and Literatures0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1098243440uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp012n49t448k03320nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002300164245006100187260005800248300001100306500008000317502004800397506006900445520051500514520073801029520098101767710005002748773005302798793001202851856015002863856001703013AAI1098270220190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866713  a(MiAaPQ)AAI10982702  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12831  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aHandwerker, Margo.10aArt/Work: The Systems-Oriented Artist Expert, 1968-1984. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a269 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aArt/Work: The Systems-Oriented Artist Expert, 1968--1984  examines the pivotal but neglected Systems art movement and its impact on contemporary social practice. Systems artists were responding in particular to the emerging modern environmental movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Their ecological thinking, inspired by cybernetics, referred both to their environmental activism and to the importance of regulation for governing systems, including a "maintenance" art system informed by ritual studies.  aThese artists' ability to make their art nearly indistinguishable from the systems that they sought to interrogate established a mode of expertise that "social practice" artists would later inherit. However, as social practice gained momentum in the mid-1980s with the rise of neoliberalism, it brought with it from Systems art a murky conflation of the activist-artists' expertise and their capacity to deliver service, the consequences of which we see now in contemporary art criticism, arts funding, and art making. Absent an account of Systems art's role in the development of contemporary social practice with regard to regulation in particular, the latter movement tends to overemphasize correcting and solving social problems.  aBy examining Systems art, we discover not only how this "ethical turn" in social practice emerged, but also how to reframe the social practice movement, moving away from its emphasis on deliverables and, instead, toward a particular kind of artistic expertise. The emphasis within Systems art was not on creating a more holistic artist who has expertise in multiple fields; rather, it was on being an artist who functions, as an expert, within a whole system of other fields of expertise that might work together. The Systems artists' transdisciplinary methods, which appear to embrace de-specialization, actually reinforce the emphasis on part-to-whole relationships so characteristic of the cybernetic era---the same quality that was also influencing the artists' ecological subjects. In light of this history, the "ethical turn" within social practice is not a flaw, but rather points to the significance of systems of governance that are shared and renegotiated over time.2 aPrinceton University.bSchool of Architecture0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1098270240uNO_ARK_FOUND03112nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001500164245010600179260005800285300001100343500008000354502004800434520034600482520054700828520046201375520037301837520024702210710008202457773005302539793001202592856015002604856005602754AAI1341893620190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866720  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13418936  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12833  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aGe, Jason.10aStatistical Optimization for High Dimensional Machine Learning with Privacy and Sparsity Constraints. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a139 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aHigh-dimensionality and privacy sensitive data in modern machine learning problems poses computational challenges that ask for novel optimization algorithms.

The somatic macronucleus constitutes the transcriptionally active focus of the cell, being responsible for all RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Separately, the germline micronucleus contains genetic information that is used to build the new somatic macronucleus upon sexual reproduction. My PhD work seeks to understand how ciliate macronuclear genomes are organized as chromatin, and how this in turn may affect gene regulation. To do so, I applied a combination of genomic and biochemical approaches to map chromatin organization in two distantly related ciliates, Oxytricha trifallax and Tetrahymena thermophila.  These organisms, having diverged > 1 billion years ago, exhibit vastly different macronuclear genome architectures: Oxytricha exhibits "nano"chromosomes that &sim;average 3kb in length, while  Tetrahymena thermophila contains megabase-sized chromosomes. Together, this comparative analysis illuminated novel principles and molecules underlying chromatin organization.  aChapter 1 consists of an introduction to the ciliate life cycle, nuclear duality, and chromatin organization.  aChapter 2 describes the discovery of DNA-guided nucleosome organization in the AT-rich macronculear genome of Tetrahymena thermophila. A combination of in vitro and in vivo MNase-seq was used to dissect the contributions of cis- and  trans-factors to nucleosome organization in Tetrahymena. .  aChapter 3 reports the genomic organization of nucleosomes, transcription start sites, and DNA adenine methylation (6mA) in Oxytricha nanochromosomes, and discovery of the corresponding 6mA methyltransferase. We found that 6mA is localized in nucleosome linker regions, near transcription start sites. Biochemical fractionation identified a novel 6mA methyltransferase -- MTA1 -- necessary for methylation. Mutation of MTA1 resulted in a genome-wide loss of 6mA methylation and enabled the functional assessment of the consequences of this perturbation on nucleosome organization and gene expression.2 aPrinceton University.b Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342048040uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01pg15bh67k03122nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001700164245010300181260005800284300001000342500008000352500004600432502004800478520074800526520065101274520058201925710005402507773005302561793001202614856015002626856005602776AAI1342048320190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866744  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13420483  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12835  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aClay, Derek.10aNovel Genetic Manipulation Approaches to Investigate Genomic Rearrangement in Oxytricha trifallax. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a68 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aIncludes supplementary digital materials.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThe dual nuclear structure of ciliates, and the derivation of the somatic nucleus from the germline nucleus makes ciliates great model system for studying genomic rearrangement. Oxytricha trifallax is a ciliate with a complex genomic rearrangement process, converting megabase sized conventional chromosomes into 16,000 kilobase sized unique chromosomes. While  Oxytricha trifallax is an excellent model organism for studying complex programmed genomic rearrangement, the unusual nature of its dual nuclear structure makes conventional genetic manipulation approaches challenging or inaccessible in Oxytricha. In this thesis, I describe various approaches for genetic manipulation I have developed and their implications to  Oxytricha biology.  aIn my thesis, I show that injecting synthetic DNA molecules homologous to native somatic chromosomes into Oxytricha at different stages in its life cycle result in divergent outcomes. Injections of synthetic chromosomes during its genomic rearrangement programs the deletion of those somatic chromosomes from the next generation. This phenomenon is robust across a variety of different somatic chromosomes. In addition, by backcrossing the programmed chromosome deletion lines to parental wild type, the programmed deletion can be inherited, implying an unidentified mechanism of elimination from soma through epigenetic inheritance in Oxytricha.  aWhile injections of artificial chromosomes during genomic rearrangement cause deletion, injections during regular growth incorporate the construct into the somatic nucleus. These introduced artificial chromosomes are stably maintained, transcribed, and successfully translated. In addition, they can be used for various applications including characterizing the functional role of Oxytricha genes with an example of such applications shown here.

A highly developed line of work has unearthed the role of striatal dopamine in model-free learning, while the prefrontal cortex (PFC) appears to critically subserve model-based learning. The recent theory of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) explained a wide array of findings by positing that the model-free dopaminergic reward prediction error trains the recurrent prefrontal network to execute arbitrary RL algorithms---including model-based RL---in its activations.  aIn parallel, a nascent understanding of a third reinforcement learning system is emerging: a non-parametric system that stores memory traces of individual experiences rather than aggregate statistics. Research on such episodic learning has revealed its unmistakeable traces in human behavior, developed theory to articulate algorithms underlying that behavior, and pursued the contention that the hippocampus is centrally involved. These developments lead to a set of open questions about (1) how the neural mechanisms of episodic learning relate to those underlying incremental model-free and model-based learning and (2) how the brain arbitrates among the contributions of this abundance of valuation strategies.  aThis thesis extends meta-RL to provide an account for episodic learning, incremental learning, and the coordination between them. In this theory of episodic meta-RL (EMRL), episodic memory reinstates activations in the prefrontal network based on contextual similarity, after passing them through a learned gating mechanism (Chapters 1 and 2). In simulation, EMRL can solve episodic contextual water maze navigation problems and episodic contextual bandit problems, including those with Omniglot class contexts and others with compositional structure (Chapter 3). Further, EMRL reproduces episodic model-based RL and its coordination with incremental model-based RL on the episodic two-step task (Vikbladh et al., 2017; Chapter 4). Chapter 5 discusses more biologically detailed extensions to EMRL, and Chapter 6 analyzes EMRL with respect to a set of recent empirical findings. Chapter 7 discusses EMRL in the context of various topics in neuroscience.2 aPrinceton University.bProgram in Neuroscience0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-06B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342081240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01dz010s84f03205nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001400164245006200178260005800240300001000298500008000308502004800388520033400436520039500770520045301165520069701618520026402315710005302579773005302632793001202685856015002697856005602847AAI1342093220190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866768  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13420932  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12837  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aTai, Amy.10aLeveraging Distributed Storage Redundancy in Datacenters. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a99 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aAll distributed storage systems replicate data objects, providing built-in redundancy that is designed to help the system withstand failures. Such redundancy is unavoidable because withstanding failures is a critical goal of distributed systems, and redundancy is the only way to tolerate failures that cause loss of data access.  aHowever, with the proliferation of data, it is becoming ever more paramount to reduce the costs of distributed storage systems. To balance the need to reduce storage costs and the need to withstand failures, this thesis explores two ways we can leverage the unavoidable redundancy in distributed storage systems to eliminate additional storage overheads in other parts of the storage stack.  aThe first system we present is Replex. The key end-to-end observation in this work is that distributed secondary indices duplicate the work done by replication. Secondary indices often store full copies of data objects,  in addition to the replicas of data objects that are created by default to handle failures. In Replex, we eliminate the additional storage overhead of secondary indices by treating them as data replicas during replication time.  aThe second system we present is DIRECT. The key end-to-end observation here is that the redundancy created by replication can and should  be used to correct bit errors at the hardware level. Traditionally, disks are expected to abstract bit errors from software, and in fact flash devices are shipped with aggressive internal error correction mechanisms to prevent errors from percolating to the user for the calculated lifetime of the device. In DIRECT, we argue that the underlying premise that disks should not expose bit errors is incorrect. In doing so, DIRECT enables the use of flash devices well beyond their advertised lifetime, which is a huge cost savings for datacenter operators.  aTherefore, by applying existing storage redundancy to enable two key properties in datacenter storage systems-- secondary indexing and flash reliability-- this thesis shows that distributed storage systems can be designed without burdensome storage overheads.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Computer Science0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342093240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp019593tx91h03149nam a2200277   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002800164245010200192260005800294300001100352500008000363502004800443520042100491520122500912520040402137710005902541773005302600793001202653856015002665856005602815AAI1342094320190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866775  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13420943  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12838  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aNg, Jonathan Wei Xiang.10aFluid Closures for the Modelling of Reconnection and Instabilities in Magnetotail Current Sheets. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a149 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThe integration of kinetic effects in fluid models is important for global simulations of the Earth's magnetosphere. Although magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), which is currently used for large scale modelling in space weather research, is a useful tool, there are other physical effects not included in the MHD model which are important at smaller scales such as the Hall effect, the pressure tensor and electron inertia.  aIn this thesis we use a two-fluid ten-moment model, which includes the pressure tensor of both species, to study some of the phenomena associated with magnetotail dynamics -- magnetic reconnection, current sheet instabilities and ballooning instabilities, followed by global simulations in which these processes interact. We first introduce an extension of existing ten-moment models by using a nonlocal heat flux, which approximates Landau damping in the fluid framework, followed by a study of magnetic reconnection during the merging of two flux tubes or magnetic islands. We then perform linear calculations and simulations of the drift-kink and lower hybrid drift instabilities in thin current sheets, and simulations of the ballooning instability in current sheets with curved mangetic geometries. Comparisons to kinetic simulations show the improvements compared to MHD and standard two-fluid models as well as the limitations of the ten-moment model. We then perform simulations which include a dipole field and self-consistent formation of the magnetotail current sheet and show that the stretching and disruption of the sheet, which is expected to occur during magnetic substorms, can be captured by the model.  aFinally, in an exploration of how the moment equations can be extended and what additional insight is gained from higher moment models, we use the maximum entropy method to reconstruct particle distributions in reconnection regions. The results show that without information other than the moments, the model can reproduce the general structure of the distributions but not all of the finer details.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Astrophysical Sciences0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342094340uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp015d86p299f02326nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001900164245007700183260005800260300001000318500008000328502004800408506006900456520118700525710007701712773005301789793001201842856015001854856005602004AAI1342130620190610161709.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866782  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13421306  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12839  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aMunro, Daniel.10aRevealing Disease-Relevant Alteration Patterns Through Data Aggregation. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a89 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aIt is important for both basic biological research and clinical applications that we not only understand the role of proteins as they are, but also how their function is affected by alterations in sequence and abundance.

Using clinical data and protein domain knowledge, we uncover two mutational patterns that affect hundreds of transcription factors in specific cancers, and analyze their significance using statistical techniques. Next, we introduce a statistical framework that utilizes paired gene expression profiles and histological images to identify proteins whose abundance associates with variation in morphological features in the tissue. Finally, we present a method to model the impact of amino acid substitutions using homolog alignments and experimental fitness measurements. We use this model to compute a directional substitution matrix based on experimental data and apply this matrix to new proteins for substitution impact prediction.

It occurred in a variety of forms, from petty thefts committed out of greed, to elaborate cursing rituals. Willful, knowing actions that violated correct religious behavior caused religious crises that had potentially deleterious consequences for both the responsible individual and for the community or state. Religious transgression was most fundamentally a problem of violating the will of the gods. The Romans had underlying assumptions that the will of the gods was knowable, and that to disregard it could cause disaster. Divine vengeance was viewed as a very real threat, and operated in concert with civic methods of punishment. Moments of religious wrongdoing were opportunities to realign public actions with the preferences of the gods, both by punishing transgressors and by enacting expiatory actions. Roman political institutions, particularly the senate, played the key roles in determining what had gone wrong religiously and how to rectify it. In smaller communities, equivalent civic bodies or magistrates fulfilled that role. The goal in rectifying a transgression was to propitiate the wronged deities and to realign Roman actions with divine interests. Transgression also developed as a trope in invective and historiographical writing, an application that was effective because it was rooted in a legitimate fear of retribution from the gods. Religious misdeeds had the power to retrospectively explain misfortunes that the Romans experienced because they were regarded with genuine trepidation.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Classics0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342163940uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01ww72bf30503316nam a2200253   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002400164245006800188260005800256300001100314500008000325502004800405520226600453710007202719773005302791793001202844856015002856856005603006AAI1342174120190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866812  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13421741  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12841  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aOmidvar, Hamidreza.10aHeat, Air and Water: How Cities Create Their Own Hydroclimates. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a201 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aMetropolitan areas are usually hotter than their surrounding rural areas due to human activities and land-use change. This phenomenon, called the Urban Heat Island (UHI), significantly alters air and surface temperature in cities and subsequently changes the dynamics of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL). However, during rainfall, hot urban surfaces cool down rapidly due to runoff advection and infiltration processes. In this dissertation, we develop a complete prognostic model that can predict atmospheric energy fluxes and the temperature of ground surfaces and runoff during rainfall. In Chapter 2, details of the model for a laminar runoff, and experimental campaigns for model validation, are discussed. In Chapter 3, we apply the model to study the physical basis and important parameters of pavement-runoff heat transfer and to develop a reduced version that is implementable in large-scale weather models. The results of Chapter 3 underline the importance of pavement albedo and rain temperature in predicting runoff and surface temperatures and heat fluxes. In Chapter 4, an extended model is developed that can be used for a broader range of rain events, even extreme events where the runoff becomes turbulent and where the penetration of raindrops into the runoff significantly alters flow dynamics and heat transfer. In Chapter 5, we shift from surface temperature to air temperature UHI impacts, and study the large-scale circulations induced by urban heat on the ABL using large eddy simulations. The results indicate that circulations are controlled by two non-dimensional parameters: (1) the ratio of convective velocities associated with urban and rural surface heat fluxes, and (2) the ratio of bulk inflow velocity and rural convective velocity. Depending on the ratio of these two parameters, city-circulations fall into three regimes: (i) a bubble regime where the ABL is mainly driven by convection, (ii) a plume regime where inflow advection is the dominant process in the ABL, and (iii) a transition regime where mixed convection is the main process. In Chapter 6, we introduce a new method for measuring water depth that we devised for runoff experiments. Finally, in Chapter 7, the synthesis and future directions are discussed.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342174140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01s7526g19g02611nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002500164245012400189260005800313300001100371500008000382502004800462506006900510520145100579710004402030773005302074793001202127856015002139856005602289AAI1342321120190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866829  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13423211  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12842  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aShaul, Hollis Shaul.14aThe Prince and the Priors: Carthusian Monasticism and the Experience of State-Building  in Angevin Provence, 1245-1385. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a252 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis dissertation examines the relationships between monastic institutions, princes, and bureaucrats in the period from 1200 to 1400. Charles of Anjou's forty-year reign as count of Provence (1245--1285) and king of Sicily was a time of intense administrative and fiscal centralization, territorial expansion, and economic growth. This dissertation tells the story of the Angevin administration through the lens of the Carthusian monasteries of Provence using monastic charter evidence, chancery documents, and inquisition records. It argues that monasteries functioned as political communities, cultivated networks of royal patrons, and cooperated with the kings of Naples in the Angevin project of extending sovereignty and consolidating jurisdiction in the medieval Mediterranean. This dissertation examines how these new royal claims disturbed the fragile rural political economy in the countryside surrounding medieval monasteries. When peasants attacked monks and slandered royal officials, they were not only fighting for their right to sustenance and use of agrarian resources but were protesting a worldview that considered monastic property as a space apart. Monasteries and princes worked together by employing a language of power and protection that combined the secular "peace of the prince" with the church's "monastic peace" to justify royal intervention in religious spaces and exert control over co-lords and the local peasantry.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of History0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342321140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01ng451m29704038nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002600164245007500190260005800265300001100323500008000334502004800414506006900462520289900531710007103430773005303501793001203554856015003566856005603716AAI1342335820190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866836  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13423358  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12843  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aChristensen, Alice R.10aTouching Temperature: Questions of Measurement and Feeling, 1870-1930. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a264 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThe dissertation uncovers a set of questions about temperature, as quality and quantity, as feeling and measurement, in German thought between 1870 and 1930. The history of this idea includes debates central to academic philosophy in the latter half of the nineteenth century, but belongs not only narrowly to philosophy or to physical theory. Instead, the dissertation shows the interconnection of concerns both scholarly and worldly, as these emerged from a diverse network of media, techniques, instruments, and bodies. The texts that intervened in the question of temperature---scientific reports, philosophical treatises and debates, literary works, and popular ephemera---expose a set of questions concerning the distinction between quantity and quality, the relationship between Erkenntnis and experience, and what it meant to dwell in a world of carefully regulated temperature. In the years around 1900, temperature traversed a vast cultural field, acting as both Zusammenhang and point of contention. Chapter One of this dissertation examines the texts and other documents of an obsession with temperature in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. In Chapter Two, I take seriously a claim by the philosopher Hermann Cohen, that the concept of degree---a particularly important concept for him---originated with our sensory apprehension of temperature. In that long history, a continual entwinement of quality and what we now call temperature is found; these two strands met explicitly in the thought of the eighteenth century philosopher Christian Wolff. The conclusions that Wolff reached, with both Scholastic philosophy and Fahrenheit's thermometers at hand, were felt in the late nineteenth century, in the debate over the measurability of sensation---which was, in many ways, an argument about the meaning of the term quality. This is the subject of Chapter Three, in which we examine nineteenth-century research into the temperature sense and the philosophical debate in which this research came to play a leading role. The terrain of the term quality had changed quite a bit since Wolff's pronouncement that "gradus sunt quantitates qualitatum." While philosophers and psychologists continued to invoke various definitions of the term, quality no longer appeared to be a useful category in the study of the physical world. Temperature, with its long association with quality, and the vexed and ambiguous assocation of both with the senses, became a site of productive tension. In Chapter Four, texts by Robert Musil, Robert Walser, and Franz Kafka are shown to address the situation of dwelling in modernity; in literary experiments, the relationship between writing and the structures of experience is explored using concepts and figures of indoor heating. The dissertation closes with a brief afterword on the notion of temperature as medium, milieu, Zusammenhang..2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Germanic Languages and Literatures0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342335840uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01hq37vr36h02036nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002000164245008200184260005800266300001100324500008000335502004800415506006900463520092200532710004501454773005301499793001201552856015001564856005601714AAI1342338220190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866843  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13423382  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12844  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aBlair, Stephen.10aFragmented Histories: Recent and Distant Pasts in Early Roman Historiography. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a184 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aRoman historical literature began with a pair of epic poets and a pair of prose historians. The precedent these early writers set became the model for later generations of Roman writers. Rather than limit themselves to a particular period or event, early Roman historians repeatedly elected to narrate the entirety of the Roman past in histories stretching continuously from the legends surrounding the foundation of the city to the recent events of the authors' lives. These hybrid works explored the first Punic war (264--241 BCE) as a decisive turning point in the Roman past, and accordingly their authors experimented with narrative patterns and modes of thought that enabled diachronic reflection around this significant moment. Through etymology, moral accounts of the past, and rationalization of myths, early Roman historians insisted on the relevance of archaic Rome to the period since the first Punic war.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Classics0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342338240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01cz30pw43m02098nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002000164245004200184260005800226300001100284500008000295502004800375506006900423520102500492710004401517773005301561793001201614856015001626856005601776AAI1342348120190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866850  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13423481  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12845  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aGreen, Elspeth.10aPopular Science and Modernist Poetry. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a173 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aPopular Science and Modernist Poetry studies the influence of popular science on modernist poetry and conceptions of literary value.

I include chapters on each of these writers, using archival material to better understand the sources of their scientific knowledge. I argue that popular science writers, in response to increasing difficulty and specialization, sought to explicate their subjects by way of metaphor; in doing so, they fashioned a version of science that was as capacious and interdisciplinary any "encyclopedic" modernist text. Metaphor became, to Richards, a "transaction between contexts," as he, Moore, and Eliot sought to defend the value of poetry in an increasingly scientific world.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of English0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342348140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp018623j151103412nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001900164245013400183260005800317300001100375500008000386502004800466520060000514520034001114520049801454520084001952710005902792773005302851793001202904856015002916856005603066AAI1342390520190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866867  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13423905  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12846  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aHoffman, John.10aBayesian Techniques for Finding and Characterizing Variable Stars: Application to the Hungarian-Made Automated Telescope Surveys. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a152 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aWide-field variability surveys like HAT (Bakos et al., 2004, 2013), OGLE (Udalski et al., 1994), Pan-STARRs (Chambers et al., 2016a), ASAS (Pojmanski, 1997; Jayasinghe et al., 2018c), and high-precision space-borne instruments such as Kepler (Koch et al., 2010), Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al., 2016), and CoRoT (CoRot Team, 2016) have revolutionized the field of variable star astronomy. The future is still brighter --- LSST (LSST Science Collaboration et al., 2009) will increase the number of known variable stars by over three orders of magnitude once the decadal survey completes in 2029.  aAnalyzing variability in 10 billion objects requires a balance between statistical rigor and computational speed. This thesis presents the development and exploration of several techniques for detecting and characterizing variable stars in time-series photometry applied to data from the HATSouth (Bakos et al., 2013) automated survey.  aThe first chapter develops a scalable algorithm for fitting periodic templates to noisy, irregularly-sampled timeseries. Template fitting is important for finding low- amplitude signals, as well as for finding and characterizing signals in very sparse timeseries. Recently (Sesar et al., 2016) used template fitting to successfully characterize O(105 ) RR Lyrae in Pan-STARRs DR1 photometry, where O(10) observations per ugrizy filter make traditional period finding techniques less sensitive.  aThe second chapter presents a study of RR Lyrae observed by HATSouth (Bakos et al., 2013). We crossmatch with several external variable star catalogs to obtain several thousand RR Lyrae, and then use a Random Forest classifier to find hundreds of new RR Lyrae in HATSouth. We perform a careful Bayesian analysis of all RR Lyrae lightcurves to characterize double mode pulsations and the Blazhko effect. The third chapter develops a semi-supervised framework for performing automated variable star classification in the presence of sparse, noisy labels. We demonstrate that these techniques are capable of learning accurate classifications despite only using three labeled examples per 7 classes during training. This approach is also capable of handling non-Euclidean features such as the phase-invariant shape of periodic lightcurves.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Astrophysical Sciences0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342390540uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp014f16c560402862nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002100164245006900185260005800254300001100312500008000323502004800403506006900451520176000520710004502280773005302325793001202378856015002390856005602540AAI1342430720190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866874  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13424307  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12847  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aKennard, Amanda.14aThe Politics of Influence in International Economic Cooperation. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a150 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis dissertation studies sources of influence in international economic cooperation. Who shapes the terms of cooperation and why? What confers advantage on some actors over others in achieving favorable cooperative outcomes? What is the role of technocratic knowledge in bargaining over policies and in their implementation? I address these questions by considering in turn the preferences of societal interest groups, the dynamics of bargaining between states, and the role of international organizations in implementing economic cooperation. Chapter 1 explores how intra-industry competition among firms generates support for measures that at face value seem to undermine firm profitability. I develop these arguments in the context of global climate change where policies to mitigate carbon emissions entail significant economic costs, but where nonetheless a growing number of firms lobby actively in favor of regulation and international cooperation. Chapter 2 considers the role of learning and expertise in shaping the dynamics of inter-state bargaining. In many settings learning and the cultivation of technocratic knowledge cannot be meaningfully separated from states' pursuit of their own self-interest. I explore how this impacts the strategic behavior of states in the context of accession negotiations within the World Trade Organization. Chapter 3 (co-authored with Diana Stanescu) considers the role of individual bureaucratic actors in shaping the implementation of cooperative policies in the context of the International Monetary Fund. We analyze the impact of senior staff appointments on financial market assessments of sovereign risk, providing evidence that senior staff members have considerable impact on Fund lending decisions.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Politics0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07A(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342430740uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp010p096970w03476nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002600164245010500190260005800295300001100353500008000364502004800444506006900492520039300561520077700954520071001731520040802441710005402849773005302903793001202956856015002968856005603118AAI1342454520190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866881  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13424545  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12848  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aBarr, Justinn Elaine.10aAll About Orb: A Role in Polarity Establishment and Autoregulatory Loop Driven Oocyte Specification. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a194 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aorb, a translational regulator of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) family, is required for multiple steps of  Drosophila oogenesis. Here we investigated orb  function at two distinct junctures. First, we investigated the role of orb in polarity establishment during midstages of oogenesis. Second, we found that oocyte specification depends on the orb 3'UTR.  aorb is needed for translational activation of the dorsal determinant gurken mRNA and the posterior/germline determinant  oskar mRNA. Localized translation of these determinants leads to the specification of the future body axes of the fly. We report that  orb functions upstream of the translation of the axis determinants and functions in the polarization of the microtubule network. Microtubule polarity within the oocyte depends on Par proteins, which establish anterior and posterior domains within the oocyte through antagonistic cross-regulatory interactions. We find that orb is needed for microtubule polarity and for the localization of Par proteins. Defects in Par protein localization may be due to orb's role in organization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton.  aThe second function of orb investigated is its role in oocyte specification. We show that the orb autoregulatory loop, in which orb protein translationally activates its own mRNA through interactions with the orb 3'UTR, is important for the establishment of oocyte identity. When the orb 3'UTR is deleted orb mRNA and protein fail to localize to within the germline cyst and ultimately all cells differentiate as nurse cells. Other markers of oocyte identity can be localized within the cyst to a subset of cells, but fail to become enriched within a single cell. We identified a fragment of the orb 3'UTR which is partially functional. In wild type, the oocyte is specified in region 2B of the germarium.  aThe partially functional 3'UTR fragment delays oocyte specification until stage 2 of oogenesis. Prior to this point, orb mRNA and protein are not localized to one cell. At stage 2, about 50% of egg chambers successfully localize orb mRNA and protein within the oocyte, suggesting that the autoregulatory loop is activated. Finally, we show that maintenance of oocyte identity also requires orb activity.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Molecular Biology0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342454540uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01w0892d72d03328nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002500164245009400189260005800283300001100341500008000352502004800432520079800480520145401278710005902732773005302791793001202844856015002856856005603006AAI1342464520190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866898  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13424645  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12849  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aHolcomb, Cole James.14aThe Microphysics of Gyroresonant Streaming Instabilities and Cosmic Ray Self-Confinement. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a169 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-06(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThe self-regulation of cosmic ray (CR) transport in the interstellar and intracluster media has long been viewed through the lenses of linear and quasilinear kinetic plasma physics. Such theories are believed to capture the essence of CR behavior in the pres- ence of self-generated turbulence, forming the basis for the so-called "self-confinement paradigm," which has been proposed to explain the isotropic propagation of CRs in the interstellar medium. However, the coupled nonlinear equations that describe the time-dependent system of CRs and electromagnetic fields are analytically intractable in the general case. Thus, obtaining analytical solutions has always relied on simplify- ing assumptions that remove potentially critical details arising from the nonlinearities of the problem.  aWe utilize the Particle-in-Cell (PIC) numerical method to study the time- dependent nonlinear behavior of the gyroresonant streaming instabilities, self- consistently following the combined evolution of particle distributions and self- generated wave spectra in one-dimensional periodic and aperiodic simulations. In the periodic case, we demonstrate that the early growth of instability conforms to the predictions from linear physics, but that the behavior can vary depending on the properties of the initial CR distribution. We emphasize that the nonlinear stages of instability depend strongly on the initial anisotropy of CRs. We derive estimates for the wave amplitudes at saturation and the time scales for relaxation of the CR distribution. In the aperiodic case, we show that the expansion of CRs from small injection regions naturally induces highly anisotropic CR distributions. Pitch-angle diffusion of CRs is then limited by the predominantly right-handed circularly polarized self-generated turbulence, allowing bulk CR drift velocities of ?0.5c. We compare against a set of analytical solutions to the CR expansion problem and find that they do not accurately predict the time-dependent properties of the CR population. We briefly study the wave damping processes of nonlinear Landau iii damping and ion-neutral friction in order to assess the viability of performing damped CR streaming simulations in the future with the PIC method.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Astrophysical Sciences0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-06B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342464540uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01r781wj82z03227nam a2200277   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002000164245007900184260005800263300001100321500008000332502004800412520086000460520089001320520040902210710005902619773005302678793001202731856015002743856005602893AAI1342477220190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866904  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13424772  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12850  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aCheng, Li-Fang.10aLarge-Scale Multi-Output Gaussian Processes for Clinical Decision Support. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a195 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-06(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aIn the scenario of real-time monitoring of hospital patients, high-quality inference of patients' health status using all information available from clinical covariates and lab tests is essential to enable successful medical interventions and improve patient outcomes. Developing a computational framework that can learn from observational large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) and make accurate real-time predictions is a critical step in achieving this goal. However, existing EHRs pose several challenges for conventional methods. For instance, many covariates are sparsely sampled in time across patients. In addition, there are substantial uncertainties in patient condition and disease progression at any time. These properties make inferring the physiological status of a patient or joint analysis of time series across patients challenging.  aThis dissertation first presents MedGP, a statistical framework that provides accurate real-time predictions of physiological states. MedGP is based on multi-output Gaussian processes, a Bayesian nonparametric model, to capture temporal structures between clinical covariates from noisy and irregularly sampled time series data. MedGP has a number of benefits over current methods. First, alignments of time series across patients are not required. Next, MedGP learns robust and interpretable relationships across covariates through regularization. Lastly, to tackle the computational bottlenecks, an approximate inference approach is derived and shown to achieve orders of speedup. The empirical results show significant improvements over baselines in making online predictions on two real-world medical data sets consist of tens of thousands of patients and millions of observations.  aFinally, two extended frameworks based on MedGP are explored to enhance clinical decision-making processes, including unifying with reinforcement learning algorithms for action recommendation and designing non-stationary kernels to learn the underlying dynamics of clinical treatments. Both methods demonstrate encouraging results on improving clinical practices and advancing towards precision medicine.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Electrical Engineering0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-06B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342477240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01mg74qp90d02829nam a2200253   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002600164245011600190260005800306300001100364500008000375502004800455520174700503710005402250773005302304793001202357856015002369856005602519AAI1342478320190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866911  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13424783  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12851  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aPelliccia, Jose Luis.14aThe Role of the Vg1 Zebrafish Ortholog GDF3 in Nodal-Dependent Mesendoderm Formation and Left-Right Patterning. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a100 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aNodal signaling plays an important role in mesendoderm formation and the placement of organs during vertebrate embryonic patterning. There are three Nodal (a TGFbeta ligand) orthologs in zebrafish; the nodal  orthologs squint (sqt or nodal-related ) and cyclops (cyc or  nodal-related 2) are required for mesendoderm formation while the  nodal ortholog southpaw (spaw) is required for the organization of organs. Here, I report on the role of another TGFbeta ligand, the Vg1 ortholog in zebrafish called Growth differentiation factor 3 (Gdf3). Vg1 orthologs have been implicated in mesoderm formation and left-right patterning in the mouse and Xenopus. However, mesoderm defects had not been observed when Gdf3 was depleted in zebrafish embryos, which suggested the need for a more comprehensive investigation of Gdf3 function during zebrafish embryonic development. Using CRISPR/Cas9 generated mutants and Gdf3 knockdown techniques, we demonstrate that maternal  gdf3 is required for Nodal-dependent mesendoderm formation. Furthermore, we show that Gdf3 is important for the formation of the left-right organizer and for Nodal signaling during left-right patterning. Our data suggest that Gdf3 is a facilitator of Nodal signaling. And although Nodal signaling can occur without Gdf3, the signaling potential is insufficient for proper mesendoderm formation and left-right patterning. Interestingly, our work also reveals that Gdf3 augments the function of the Nodal signaling inhibitor Lefty1. Collectively, our data indicate that Gdf3 potentiates the function of the Nodal ligand to promote robust Nodal signaling, while also enhancing the function of Lefty1 to negatively regulate signaling pathways during zebrafish embryonic development.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Molecular Biology0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342478340uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01gq67jt97403127nam a2200265   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100003200164245004500196260005800241300001100299500008000310502004800390506006900438520201300507710007002520773005302590793001202643856015002655856005602805AAI1342523320190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866928  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13425233  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12853  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aGrobis, Matthew Mieczyslaw.10aStructure and Survival in Animal Groups. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a126 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aSocial grouping has repeatedly evolved in animals as a way of responding to and controlling their external environment. These groups are often greater than the sum of their parts: simple local interactions between individuals can give rise to complex group-level behaviors not possible at the individual level. The structure of the group -- the spatial positions, orientations, and sensory neighborhoods of group members -- is both a product and modulator of these local interactions, playing a critical role in how groups interact with their environments. Despite this importance, much of our understanding of the relationships between local interactions, group structure, and emergent behaviors has remained restricted to theoretical models due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable individual-level data in mobile animal groups. Recent advances in computer vision, however, now grant us the ability to observe within-group dynamics at a resolution detailed enough to finally test theories on how local interactions give rise to emergent group-level properties -- as well as the intermediary role of group structure. In this thesis, I collected high-resolution data on schooling fish, known for their dynamic group structure, to examine local interactions, group structure, and the resulting consequences on survival. In Chapter 2, I quantify the distribution of visual information in fish schools and show that vision can be a useful metric for labeling the interior versus exterior of groups. In Chapter 3, I demonstrate that changes in information transfer due to perception of predation risk can be entirely attributed to group structure, with negligible changes in local interactions. Finally, in Chapter 4, I use live predator-prey interactions to empirically link group structure to survival, highlighting the importance of density and vision. Overall, this thesis adds to a growing movement of validating and improving upon our models of collective movement, cognition, and antipredator behavior.2 aPrinceton University.b Dept. of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342523340uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01bz60d005t03640nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002000164245007400184260005800258300001100316500008000327502004800407520038600455520042100841520056301262520056901825520060102394710007202995773005303067793001203120856015003132856005603282AAI1342597420190610161710.5190610s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780438866942  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13425974  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12855  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aUralcan, Betul.10aComputer-Aided Understanding of Perturbations in Soft Matter Systems. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a171 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 80-07(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis dissertation aims to advance the fundamental knowledge on the structure and dynamics of condensed matter, focusing on systems relevant to emerging problems in biotechnology and energy. We aim to do this using tools and techniques derived from statistical mechanics with the aid of computer simulations, and when appropriate, combined with principles from experimental science.  aIn the first part, we study the effects of solution composition on the electrochemical response of a double layer capacitor using electrical impedance spectroscopy measurements and molecular dynamics simulations in a constant potential ensemble. We find that capacitance first increases with ion concentration following its expected ideal solution behavior but decreases upon approaching the pure ionic liquid limit.  aIn the second part, we use atomistic replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations and thermodynamic analysis to investigate the effects of ionic liquid-induced perturbations on the folding/unfolding thermodynamics of the Trp-cage miniprotein, and compare our findings to circular dichroism measurements. We find that ionic liquid-induced denaturation resembles cold unfolding, where unfolded states are populated by compact, partially folded structures in which elements of the secondary structure are conserved, while the tertiary structure is disrupted.  aIn the third part, we perform a fully atomistic computational study of Trp-cage in explicit water, and construct the complete stability diagram in the (P,T) plane. At ambient temperature, we find that application of pressure shifts the equilibrium of conformational states towards denaturation. Below 250K, the stability of the native fold depends non-monotonically upon pressure. Our simulations also show while cold unfolding and thermal denaturation mechanisms differ significantly at ambient pressure, they exhibit progressive similarity at elevated pressures.  aIn the final part, we consider three commonly used molecular water models (ST2, TIP4P/2005, and TIP5P) that support the existence of the metastable liquid-liquid transition. We demonstrate that a corresponding-states-like rescaling of pressure and temperature results in a significant degree of universality in the pattern of thermodynamic response function extrema. We also report an intriguing correlation between the location of the liquid-liquid critical point, the density extrema locus, and the liquid-vapor stability limit, and demonstrate a similar correlation for two theoretical models.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg80-07B(E).  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342597440uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp0176537414b
