These competitive malfunctions led to public utility-style regulation for these industries in which regulators determined market entry, exit, prices, and service options for regulated firms. Beginning in the 1970s, the economic deregulation movement vowed to reintroduce market competition to industries dominated by regulated monopolies and cartels. Now four decades later, many deregulated industries have—contrary to expectations—grown more concentrated and less competitive. Comparing the deregulation of freight railroading and wireline telecommunications in the United States, this dissertation offers a historically grounded explanation for the emergence of deregulated market power.I highlight a common dilemma in such infrastructure industries. To compete, network service providers must have network access to end customers. To the extent network access is concentrated in the hands of a few incumbents, potential rivals with limited network assets of their own operate at a distinct disadvantage in entering new markets.Recognizing these challenges, policymakers have adopted different solutions to problems of concentrated network access. In freight railroading, policymakers encouraged intermodal competition between rival transportation modes (railroad versus truck, barge, or pipeline). In wireline telecommunications, policymakers by contrast encouraged the sharing of incumbent networks with competitors. The origins of these different network access regimes were rooted in how each industry was deregulated differently in response to different industry problems. As such, deregulation followed an industry-specific logic. In freight railroading, the bailout of bankrupt carriers permitted greater network consolidation. In wireline telecommunications, efforts to undo the historically unprecedented telephone monopoly of AT&T led to greater network fragmentation.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aSociology. 4aAmerican history.  a0337  a062620aPrinceton University.bSociology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342485603853nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100003500159245012000194260005800314300001100372500007800383500004200461500002800503502004800531506006900579506006700648506005900715520226400774590002303038650001203061650003103073650001803104690000903122690000903131690000903140710004103149773005103190790000903241791001003250792000903260793001203269856015003281AAI1342557220191111131201.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059869  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13425572  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12854  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aEscobar, Jose Antonio Araguez.10aRethinking the Formal Domain: Deep Scientization of Design and Architecture-Engineering Hybrid, 1956-2006 Volume I. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a633 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Lavin, Sylvia.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation identifies the emergence of a sublineage in the tradition of the architecture-engineering hybrid between the mid-1950s and the mid-2000s through an examination of the work of Vittorio Giorgini (1926–2010), Michael Burt (b. 1937), and Cecil Balmond (b. 1943). These three figures operated at the margins of the architecture discipline, but none was an architect-engineer in any customary sense. Rather, it is the ensemble of their production that, embodying a three-dimensionality characteristic of the nature, purview, and scale of architecture—if strongly driven by science and by aspects traditionally associated with structural engineering—I interpret as constituting the said sublineage.The discussion of Giorgini’s, Burt’s, and Balmond’s bodies of work is here framed in relation to both the general and the particular conditions of possibility enabling their appearance: the general conditions being an overarching paradigm triggered by an acute scientization of design that unfolded across the West over the course of the second half of the twentieth century; the particular conditions—wired into the general—being the specific academic, professional, and discursive contexts in which each design thinking originated and evolved. I illustrate the degree to which each body of work, while determined by these two levels of contextual influence, was idiosyncratic with respect to both, and show the importance of their differentiating traits. For I argue and attempt to demonstrate that the architectural thinking embedded in the idiosyncratic character of the oeuvre of Giorgini, Burt, and Balmond gives rise to a realm of design that is a distinctly appropriate medium through which to craft a new conceptualization of form in architecture.In pursuing this argument and attendant conceptualization, I seek to rethink the bounds of the formal domain in architectural thinking. In contrast to formal epistemologies revolving around external envelope, volumetric outline, or “mass,” this study is grounded in the notion of spatial organization and related terms such as configuration, arrangement, and disposition. The former sphere of signification is made to correspond to “shape” and the latter to form proper.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aDesign. 4aArchitectural engineering. 4aArchitecture.  a0389  a0462  a072920aPrinceton University.bArchitecture.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342557203934nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100003700159245013300196260005800329300001100387500007800398500004200476500003000518502004800548506006900596506006700665506005900732520243200791590002303223650002803246690000903274710003603283773005103319790000903370791001003379792000903389793001203398856015003410AAI1342674020191111131201.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059890  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13426740  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12858  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aVedoveli Francisco, Paula Elena.10aPrivate Capital, Public Credit: Brazil, Argentina, and the Problem of Credibility in International Capital Markets, 1852—1914. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a743 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Adelman, Jeremy.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aPrivate Capital, Public Credit examines how Brazilian and Argentine governments promoted their public credit at international capital markets from the 1850s to World War I. It focuses on the relationships that connected sovereign governments to contractors and issuers of foreign debt in London and Paris, and particularly on credibility brokers, a group of actors responsible for establishing and maintaining these connections. Credibility brokers were able to manage the flow of information between decision-makers in borrowing countries and bankers in international capital markets and promoted trusting relationships with actors on both sides of the Atlantic through repeated interactions and the development of affective bonds. Credibility brokers, therefore, shaped financial intermediaries' capacity to assess sovereign risk and influenced debtors' ability to make and sustain credible commitments. Their performance was dependent on the actors' private capital, including the character of the ties that connected them to statesmen in Latin America and bankers in Europe, their ability to adopt the elements that constituted the culture of personal credibility, their capacity to operate independently in capital markets and control the nature of the information available to European investors, and the political capital they enjoyed amongst decision-making elites in borrowing countries.This cosmopolitan model of credibility brokerage started to wane in the last decade of the nineteenth century when financial crises in Brazil and Argentina and the failure of one of the most reputable banking houses in London undermined investors’ trust on the capacity of financial intermediaries to correctly assess risk and monitor sovereign borrowers. The transition to a model of sovereign credibility based on economic indicators and credit-ratings occurred gradually in the first half of the twentieth century. The adoption of this model signaled a growing distrust towards the capacity of personal judgment and knowledge to regulate sovereign bond markets, while the expansion of the investing public and the erosion of actors’ capacity to control the flow of information enabled the change. Credibility brokers, however, have remained a feature of sovereign bond markets, called to perform their roles when the power of numbers has proved insufficient to broker credible commitments in times of heightened uncertainty.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aLatin American history.  a033620aPrinceton University.bHistory.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342674002552nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002700159245007000186260005800256300001100314500007800325500004200403500003400445502004800479506006900527506006700596506005900663520102200722590002301744650001501767650002001782650002201802690000901824690000901833690000901842710003801851773005101889790000901940791001001949792000901959793001201968856015001980AAI1342694220191111131201.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059906  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13426942  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12859  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPangborn, Nicole Anne.10aEthnicity, Emotions, and Relations in an Italian-American Suburb. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a155 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Duneier, Mitchell D.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation examines the persistence of Italian-American ethnicity in the suburbs of Providence, Rhode Island.

I show how, over the course of social interaction, the legacies of Italian-American ethnicity in this particular place work to shape individuals' feelings of self-worth, to structure their relations with others, to limit occupational and residential mobility, and to inform interpretations of current events. These findings a.) run contrary to the expectations of scholars who view ethnicity for late-generation European groups as no more than "symbolic" (Gans, 1979), b.) contribute to a better understanding of the current historical moment in the United States, and c.) complicate sociological perspectives on assimilation and ethnic group relations more generally.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aSociology. 4aEthnic studies. 4aAmerican studies.  a0626  a0631  a032320aPrinceton University.bSociology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342694203761nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002600159245009600185260005800281300001100339500007800350500004200428500002800470502004800498506006900546506006700615506005900682520225300741590002302994650002303017650001803040690000903058690000903067710004603076773005103122790000903173791001003182792000903192793001203201856015003213AAI1342741320191111131201.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059913  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427413  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12860  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKoos, Joseph Douglas.10aInvestigation of the Maturation and Degradation of Lasso Peptides through In Vitro Studies. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a148 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Link, Aaron J.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aLasso peptides are a class of small molecules characterized by a unique threaded structure. In addition to this shape, lasso peptides are also of interest due to their range of properties, ranging from narrow spectrum anti-microbial to inhibiting viral envelope fusion. In recent years, with the increase in genomes available, it has become apparent that lasso peptides are present in a wider range of bacteria than had been identified through traditional natural products screening. In Chapters 2, a gene cluster containing two lasso peptides from the freshwater bacterium Asticcacaulis excentricus was examined to learn more about the promiscuity of lasso peptide related enzymes. The gene cluster contained a novel enzyme, termed a lasso isopeptidase, which can turn lasso peptides into a linear form. Using alanine scanning of the precursor peptides, it was determined that both the maturation enzymes as well as the isopeptidase were able to process a range of substrates. In Chapter 3, the structure of the isopeptidase enzyme was solved with and without precursor to learn more about how it recognized its substrates. In addition, the isopeptidase sequence was used to identify novel lasso peptide gene clusters, further expanding the known examples for this class. In Chapter 4, a novel lasso peptide gene cluster from Thermobifida fusca, a thermophilic bacterium, was identified as a source of soluble maturation enzymes for lasso peptide biosynthesis. The product was produced both through heterologous expression in E. coli, as well as by incubation of the precursor peptide with the maturation enzymes in vitro. This system was used to determine for the first time information about lasso peptide biosynthetic rates. In Chapter 5, a lasso peptide gene cluster was identified from Thermobifida cellulosilytica with a previously unidentified O-methyltransferase within the cluster. In addition, a similar enzyme was also identified within an unexplored class of products called actinopeptides. Each of these systems was explored through a combination of heterologous expression and in vitro experiments. Through the course of these studies, lasso peptide biosynthesis and degradation are on a more solid foundation for future examination.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aBiochemistry.  a0307  a048720aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342741304018nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002100159245007200180260005800252300001100310500007800321500004200399500003000441502004800471506006900519506006700588506005900655520247600714590002303190650002803213650002303241650002803264690000903292690000903301690000903310710003603319773005103355790000903406791001003415792000903425793001203434856015003446AAI1342762620191111131202.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059920  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427626  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12861  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMack, Jessica R.10aA Campus for Mexico: Knowledge and Power in UNAM's University City. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a278 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Adelman, Jeremy.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn June of 1950, the first stone was ceremoniously placed on a construction site several kilometers south of Mexico City’s center. Building had officially begun on a long-imagined campus for the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM): the utopian Ciudad Universitaria, or University City. By tracing its spatial reconfiguration on a new modernist campus, this dissertation explains the national university’s shifting role in Mexico’s developing revolutionary state and examines the ways in which new national priorities were inscribed upon intellectual and cultural life. The largest university in Latin America, with over 330,000 students today and a sprawling 2,500-acre urban campus, UNAM has trained Mexico’s most powerful decision makers, set the terms of public debates and posed questions that have shaped decades of policy. It is also an important channel through which citizens have participated—with both consent and contestation—in Mexico’s twentieth-century public life. Although it is an icon of modern Mexico, we know surprisingly little about UNAM’s historical role in shaping the social landscape and the reproduction of power. From the earliest imaginings of a utopian lettered city immediately after the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), this project traces the long twentieth-century arc of Ciudad Universitaria’s creation alongside the national university’s turbulent relationship with the revolutionary state. As the prominent modernist architects of Ciudad Universitaria solidified the ruling party’s interpretation of the revolution in stone, social justice and agrarian reform were replaced by a new set of priorities. In conversation with a growing body of scholarship on Mexico’s midcentury, the dissertation explores how this monumental state building project spatially manifested the ruling party’s vision for Mexico’s future and was made possible by its new priorities of urbanization, industrialization and developmentalism. From imagining and planning the campus in the late 1940s to its rapid construction from 1950-1954, the dissertation uses the archives of planners, architects, local residents and bureaucrats to reveal new modes of operating. Once students and faculty arrived, the project traces intellectual and social reconfiguration at Ciudad Universitaria, changes that would reshape Mexico City’s urban landscape and realign contestation in national politics into the late twentieth century.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aLatin American history. 4aEducation history. 4aLatin American studies.  a0336  a0520  a055020aPrinceton University.bHistory.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342762603864nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001400159245005600173260005800229300001100287500007800298500004200376500003700418502004800455506005900503520256200562590002303124650001303147650002003160690000903180690000903189710005103198773005103249790000903300791001003309792000903319793001203328856015003340AAI1342775720191111131202.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059937  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427757  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12862  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aDong, Ge.10aNonlinear Dynamics of the Kinetic Ballooning Modes. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a124 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Bhattacharjee, Amitava.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aKinetic ballooning modes (KBM) are widely believed to play a critical role in explosive and disruptive dynamics in laboratory and space plasmas. While the nonlinear evolution of ballooning modes has been proposed as a mechanism for the eruptive events in the tokamak edge, known as edge localized modes (ELMs), and magnetospheric substorms, the role of kinetic effects in such nonlinear dynamics with potentially impulsive behavior remains largely unexplored. Detailed studies of the KBM nonlinear dynamics can help in understanding the cause and properties of the eruptive behavior and large turbulent transport in ELMs, and potentially contribute in our ability to predict and even control them in experiments. In this thesis nonlinear dynamics and saturation mechanism of KBM are presented using primarily global gyrokinetic particle-in-cell simulation results. The compressional component of magnetic perturbation δB∥ can be important for KBM in high β plasmas. A numerical scheme that includes δ B∥ in first-principles gyrokinetic simulations has been formulated, implemented and benchmarked as a first step. With the perturbed electrostatic potential, and both the perpendicular and the parallel magnetic perturbations, KBM nonlinear evolution is studied for the Cyclone Base Case (CBC) parameters. In contrast to the finite-time singularity predicted by ideal MHD theory, the kinetic instability is shown to develop into an intermediate nonlinear regime of exponential growth, followed by a nonlinear saturation regulated by spontaneously generated zonal fields. The zonal fields, including both the zonal flow (flux-surface averaged electrostatic potential) and the zonal current (flux-surface averaged parallel vector potential), are shown to be important in governing the nonlinear mode structure, and in suppressing trans- port. The kinetic intermediate nonlinear regime resembles the intermediate regime already discovered in the full MHD simulations. During this regime, rapid growth of localized current sheet, which can induce tearing mode and magnetic reconnection, is observed. In the KBM simulations using experimentally measured equilibrium at the DIII-D tokamak edge, the nonlinear convective motion appears to compete with the shearing effect produced by zonal fields, which is weaker in the narrow pedestal steep gradient region compared with that in the core plasma. The effects of the zonal fields and the nonlinear non-zonal convection together regulate the KBM nonlinear saturation level in the DIII-D steep gradient region.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysics. 4aPlasma physics.  a0605  a075920aPrinceton University.bAstrophysical Sciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342775703381nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002600159245005400185260005800239300001100297500007800308500004200386500004500428502004800473506005900521520197500580590002302555650002702578650002602605650002002631690000902651690000902660690000902669710006402678773005102742790000902793791001002802792000902812793001202821856015002833AAI1342783120191111131203.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059944  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427831  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12863  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSantos, Andrew Pablo.10aSurfactant and Colloid Self-assembly Simulations. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a135 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aSurfactants and colloids are ubiquitous in biology, the environment, home and personal care products, and industrial applications. The self-assembly of surfactants into micellar aggregates is crucial to their use in many industrial applications, including: detergency, cosmetics, oil-spill remediation and nanoparticle dispersion. Because of their ubiquity, surfactant and colloid self-assembly are canonical subjects of soft matter study, yet there are concentration effects, for example the free surfactant concentration, that remain difficult to measure and understand. We present our findings on the driving forces behind aspects of self-assembly and methodologies for characterizing the behavior of three self-assembling systems: colloids with short-range attraction long-range repulsion, nonionic surfactants and ionic surfactants. To study molecular details of these systems, we use Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with implicit-solvent models. We directly compare different methods for calculating the critical micelle concentration in all self-assembling systems. We establish that excluded volume and counterion condensation are the main driving forces for the decrease of free surfactant concentration in nonionic and ionic surfactants, respectively. We compare counterion condensation and mean ionic activity measurements directly to experiments, and address experimental disagreements. For short-range attraction long-range repulsion colloids, conditions are found where large preferred aggregates have no net effect on the pressure, which is strikingly different behavior from surfactant self-assembly. The results in this thesis offer a deeper understanding of the phenomena of low-concentration self-assembly, leading to improved methods for estimating micellar properties over wider concentration ranges. These methods will benefit the development of more accurate molecular models and speed up development of new industrial formulations.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputational physics. 4aChemical engineering. 4aNanotechnology.  a0216  a0542  a065220aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342783103550nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001900159245008800178260005800266300001100324500007800335500004200413500004000455502004800495506005900543520217000602590002302772650001402795650001402809650002502823690000902848690000902857690000902866710003602875773005102911790000902962791001002971792000902981793001202990856015003002AAI1342786720191111131203.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059951  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427867  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12864  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aAdair, Carl C.10aFaithful Readings: Religion, Hermeneutics, and the Habits of Criticism 1880–1950. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a203 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Fuss, Diana;Kotin, Joshua.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aFaithful Readings outlines a revisionist history of the discourse and practice of Anglo-American literary criticism between 1880 and 1950. This dissertation contests the secularization narratives that structure many received histories of the discipline, narratives in which habits of critical interpretation and reflection inevitably supersede or simply survive a credulous, pre-modern religion that had become increasingly untenable through the nineteenth century. The project presents a genealogy of this enduring concept of religion as naive and literal belief, arguing that the concept was produced as a polemical strategy in a theological contest: it was first promoted not by disinterested secular critics but by the under-remarked nineteenth-century theological movement known as Protestant modernism as a dismissive depiction of its theological rivals. For modernists, faith was a self-consciously interpretive relation to the Christian tradition as a complex of historically and culturally mediated forms whose ultimate object was an ineffable, infinite reality: defined against propositional belief, true religion was a way of reading this tradition critically. This dissertation argues that the habits of literary criticism developed in this period were recursively entangled with the powerful and problematic hermeneutics that defined this one contemporary Protestant theology. In chapters dedicated to the reading practices of such formative figures as Matthew Arnold, John Crowe Ransom, Cleanth Brooks, and T.S. Eliot, the project elucidates the political, epistemological, and institutional pressures that led both biblical and literary critics to develop new methods to legitimize their work as specialized, modern disciplines and also to remain faithful to their cherished texts as authorities that exceeded the knowledge such specialized methods could produce. Thinking beyond the purported opposition between the critical and the religious, the project defamiliarizes tensions within enduring habits of literary criticism and invites serious reflection on the forms of discipline that may be required should critics decide to change their habits.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aReligion. 4aTheology. 4aAmerican literature.  a0318  a0469  a059120aPrinceton University.bEnglish.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342786704445nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001700159245009900176260005800275300001100333500007800344500004200422500003200464502004800496506005900544520305600603590002303659650002003682650001303702650001803715690000903733690000903742690000903751710004603760773005103806790000903857791001003866792000903876793001203885856015003897AAI1342790320191111131203.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059968  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427903  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12865  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHan, Siyang.10aBiomechanical Regulation of Cell Proliferation, Epithelialmesenchymal Transition and Invasion. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a127 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Nelson, Celeste M.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aCells in epithelial tissues adhere to an underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) and respond to changes in its physical properties by altering gene expression and behavior. The mechanical properties of the ECM, including the matrix stiffness, are therefore central to developmental, physiological, and pathological processes. In the context of cancer, increased tissue stiffness and interstitial fluid pressure are inherent features of tumorigenesis, which promote malignant transformation of surrounding cells and correlate with poor survival. These processes depend on the synergistic effects of mechanical signals such as ECM stiffness and chemical signals such as Wnt, TGFβ and proteases in the cellular microenvironment. This dissertation explores how mechanical and biochemical signals are integrated to control cell behaviors including proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasion. We used engineered substrata to recapitulate the mechanical stiffnesses of the normal mammary gland as well as that of breast tumors.We found that exposure to Wnt3a increased proliferation of mammary epithelial cells cultured on stiff substrata, with compliances characteristic of breast tumors, but not of cells on soft substrata, with compliances comparable to that of normal mammary tissue. Depleting integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which functions as a signaling hub for cellular mechanotransduction, rendered cells unresponsive to Wnt3a on both substrata. Ectopic expression of ILK permitted Wnt3a to induce proliferation of cells on both microenvironments. We further showed that ILK regulates expression of the Wnt receptor frizzled-1 (Fzd1), suggesting the existence of a positive feedback loop between Wnt3a, ILK and Fzd1.Following these findings, we examined the role of ILK and tissue stiffness in regulating cell fate in response to TGFβ1. We found that ILK controls the switch between apoptosis and EMT downstream of TGF?1 through modulating the fine balance between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. Specifically, depletion of ILK leads to increased E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion and cortical actin and decreased focal adhesions and stress fibers in mammary epithelial cells. These changes favor apoptosis and suppress EMT downstream of TGFβ1, regardless of matrix stiffness. Similarly, soft matrix also favors apoptosis downstream of TGFβ1 while stiff matrix promotes EMT, suggesting that depletion of ILK disrupts the ability of a cell to sense a mechanically stiff microenvironment.Taken together, these findings suggest that tissue mechanics regulates the cellular response to Wnt and TGFβ under physiological and pathological microenvironmental conditions. We also highlighted the role of ILK in mediating the responses to matrix stiffness and tuning the proliferative and potential tumorigenic behaviors of mammary epithelial cells to Wnt3a and TGFβ1. These results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of a pathological microenvironment on neoplastic progression.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aBioengineering. 4aBiology. 4aBiomechanics.  a0202  a0306  a064820aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342790303332nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001900159245006500178260005800243300001100301500007800312500004200390500002600432502004800458506006700506506005900573520194500632590002302577650002302600650001802623690000902641690000902650710004602659773005102705790000902756791001002765792000902775793001202784856015002796AAI1342795220191111131204.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059975  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427952  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12866  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aJani, Krupa S.10aMechanistic Studies of Epigenetic Regulation by the H3 Tail. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a179 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Muir, Tom W.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe N-terminal tail of histone H3 is heavily post-translationally modified. Numerous regulatory lysine residues are methylated, and these modifications play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression. Trimethylation at H3K27 (H3K27me3) is associated with transcriptional silencing of genes important in growth and development. Intriguingly, H3K27me3 is mutually exclusive with H3K36 tri-methylation on the same histone tail. Disruptions in this crosstalk result in aberrant H3K27/H3K36 methylation patterns and altered transcriptional profiles that have been implicated in tumorigenesis and other disease states. Despite their importance, the molecular details of this crosstalk are unclear. This thesis presents work revealing an unusual mode of allosteric enzyme modulation by its histone H3 substrate molecule. PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation is sensitive to the chromatin environment, including the methylation state of H3K36 on the same histone tail.    We demonstrate that PRC2 is allosterically activated in cis by the unmodified side chain of H3K36, and that this activation results in a 5-fold increase in the kcat of its enzymatic activity catalyzing H3K27 methylation compared to activity on a substrate methylated at H3K36. Utilizing a photocrosslinking-MS strategy and histone methyltransferase activity assays with PRC2 mutants, we find that the catalytic subunit EZH2 contains a specific sensing pocket for H3K36 methylation state which allows the PRC2 complex to distinguish between modified and unmodified H3K36 residues, altering enzymatic activity accordingly to preferentially methylate the unmodified nucleosome substrate. Avenues for inhibition of PRC2 by targeting its interactions with the H3 tail are also explored. Beyond its interactions with polycomb machinery, H3K36 and other sections of the H3 tail may also have roles of epigenetic regulation of other cellular processes such as DNA damage response.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aBiochemistry.  a0307  a048720aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342795204323nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001400159245005800173260005800231300001100289500007800300500004200378500003300420502004800453506006900501506005900570520289200629590002303521650002303544650002203567650001803589690000903607690000903616690000903625710003803634773005103672790000903723791001003732792000903742793001203751856015003763AAI1342796220191111131204.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059982  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427962  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12867  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChen, Li.10aQuantitative Analysis of Folate and NADPH Metabolism. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a146 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Rabinowitz, Joshua.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aFolic acid and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) play important roles in supporting cell growth. Folic acid, known as vitamin B9, is critical for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis by mediating the transfer and transformation of a one-carbon unit. NADPH, derived from niacin or vitamin B3, is the high-energy electron carrier that is used for antioxidant defense, as well as the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, fatty acid and sterols. It is thought that synergy of the two pathways for cell growth may include direct metabolic interactions, and cancer cells may hijack these pathways for uncontrolled proliferation. However, a comprehensive understanding of folate and NADPH metabolism are hindered by the instability and low abundance of related species.Here, on the folate side, we developed an analytical method to measure intracellular folate species from mammalian cells, using an isotope-labeling strategy combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This new method has enabled a CRISPR knockout folate metabolism study that showed a reversal of the cytosolic folate pathway is capable of compensating mitochondrial folate deficiency. On the NADPH side, we quantitatively demonstrated that the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) is the main source of NADPH’s high energy electrons across cancer cell lines, through a deuterium ( 2H) isotope tracing analysis and a CRISPR knockout study. In the 2H tracing analysis, we found the redox-active hydrogen on NADPH can exchange with ambient water through a Flavin-enzyme catalyzed mechanism. Analysis of major NADPH production pathway knockout cells also suggested any of the oxPPP, malic enzyme 1 (ME1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is enough to support cell growth, but oxPPP is uniquely required to maintain a normal NADPH/NADP ratio in cancer cell lines. Previous literature showed that the folate pathway could be an important NADPH production pathway, especially in combating oxidative stress for human melanoma cells during metastasis. We discovered a second NADPH-folate connection that high NADP inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), resulting in impaired folate-mediated biosynthesis across different cancer cell lines. To explore the terrain of metabolism, we developed a computational network analysis approach for new metabolites discovery by connecting mass from untargeted metabolomics data and known metabolite database. The concept has been validated by analyzing an annotated yeast metabolomics dataset, and preliminary results identified a cluster of potential metabolites specifically accumulated in kidney that may relate to thiamine (vitamin B1) metabolism.In summary, this study provides novel methods and insights to study folate and NADPH metabolism, shedding light on the intricacy of metabolism for cell growth and potential cancer therapeutics.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aCellular biology. 4aBiochemistry.  a0307  a0379  a048720aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342796203937nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002400159245008900183260005800272300001100330500007800341500004200419500004500461502004800506506005900554520249200613590002303105650002603128650003003154650002303184690000903207690000903216690000903225710006403234773005103298790000903349791001003358792000903368793001203377856015003389AAI1342804620191111131204.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059999  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428046  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12868  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aReinhart, Wesley F.10aStrategies for Predicting, Understanding, and Controlling Colloidal Crystallization. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a204 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aColloidal crystals continue to draw attention for their applications in photonics, energy conversion, and biosensing, as well as for their usefulness in elucidating questions in fundamental physics and materials science. However, the wide range of applications for these particles is made possible by the equally wide range of possible self-assembled structures, which may be amorphous or crystalline, close-packed or open, and may include defects with varying morphology and concentration. Experiments, simulations, and theoretical treatments have all shown that this rich phase behavior is enabled by relatively weak interactions between the particles, which leads to small differences in free energy between competing equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures, presenting unique challenges in the fabrication and analysis of the resulting materials. This dissertation explores two complementary topics which both support the goal of engineering advanced materials through directed assembly of colloidal crystals.In the first half of this work, I explore the crystallization of triblock Janus colloids through a variety of simulation methods. I begin by calculating the equilibrium thermodynamic phase diagrams for these particles under a wide variety of conditions, quantifying the driving forces which stabilize each of the competing crystal polymorphs. I next evaluate the crystallization kinetics of several of these solid phases, finding that the different assembly mechanisms of each crystal lattice lead to surprising behaviors. Finally, I demonstrate how a patterned substrate biases the morphology of a crystal film toward large single crystals of a particularly useful polymorph.In the second half, I develop a novel framework for crystal characterization which infers relationships between observed structures automatically rather than relying on pre-programmed templates. I begin by establishing the mathematical basis for this method, showing how my Neighborhood Graph Analysis (NGA) can be used to identify crystal lattices from particle tracking data. Next I extend the framework to binary systems, demonstrating the first-ever automatic characterization of binary superlattices. Finally, I describe a streamlined version of the algorithm which reduces the computational cost by several orders of magnitude, allowing it to be implemented into a fully automated characterization and visualization workflow which is used to investigate a wide variety of crystal lattices.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemical engineering. 4aCondensed matter physics. 4aMaterials science.  a0542  a0611  a079420aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342804603972nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001900159245010300178260005800281300001100339500007800350500004200428500004800470502004800518506006900566506005900635520252500694590002303219650001703242650002103259690000903280690000903289710004703298773005103345790000903396791001003405792000903415793001203424856015003436AAI1342805220191111131205.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060001  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428052  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12869  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aAyers, Elaine.10aStrange Beauty: Botanical Collecting, Preservation, and Display in the Nineteenth Century Tropics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a547 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Burnett, D.

The plants written into scientific and aesthetic descriptions of “tropical nature,” I argue, constructed a view of rainforests as extractable, collectible storehouses caught somewhere between fecundity and loss, between beauty and decay. I focus on four plants transformed from curious objects in the field to herbarium specimens in Britain and Europe bound up in debates over evolution and "normalcy" while speaking to the developing ideals and disillusionments of tropical nature. These objects confused reproductive boundaries, embodying the possibilities and perceived environmental dangers while challenging typical labor practices producing a collectible, useful, and containable nature.Chapter One follows the most miniscule, mundane, of plants: Moss. Paradoxically figured as both "pure" in its seemingly invisible self-reproduction and salacious in its place in pornography, moss functioned as a preservative agent for more "valuable" plants. Simultaneously, botanists interested in moss on its own terms transformed this packing material into an object of microscopic inquiry. Next, I follow an orchid illustrated by a prolific female artist. Explicitly sexualized in their depictions, orchids challenged aesthetic representations, transforming the technical process of botanical illustration while contributing to a false construction of the tropics inevitably leading to affective dissonances among naturalists. Here, theories of color and artistic practice become central to the politics of botanical preservation and display. Chapter Three traces a carnivorous pitcher plant collected by a liminal figure working for the East India Company. The pitcher plant came to crystallize colonial fears of environmental pushback—the phallic, carnivorous plant challenged theories of order while provoking questions about colonial consumption. I end with the largest and rarest plant in the world—the corpse flower. That a flower could actively mimic animal behavior to attract pollinators upended the chain of floral being. Resistant to all forms of collection, preservation, and display, the corpse flower proved to be the ultimate form of tropical nature’s resistance to human intervention and control.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aArt history. 4aScience history.  a0377  a058520aPrinceton University.bHistory of Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342805203494nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002000159245009900179260005800278300001100336500007800347500004200425500003900467502004800506506006900554506005900623520197500682590002302657650002202680650002202702650003002724690000902754690000902763690000902772690000902781710004102790773005102831790000902882791001002891792000902901793001202910856015002922AAI1342810120191111131205.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060018  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428101  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12870  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPearson, Heath.14aThe Carceral Outside How Privatized Land Produces Racialized Labor in an American Prison Town. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a264 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Biehl, Joao;Perry, Imani.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  a"The Carceral Outside" explores the evolution of a rural town in New Jersey that, over the course of two hundred years of capital accumulation, has transformed from an agricultural hub into a town with four prisons, a regional jail, and three police departments. It examines how the transformation of land over time was related to the search for and exploitation of laborers, and how that relationship between land and labor became racialized, paving the way for a rural "prison town." The study is anchored by a detailed land history of each prison site, beginning in the late-eighteenth century and continuing to the present, and is bolstered by a chronicle of family and life histories based on more than two hundred ethnographic interviews. Additional data were supplied by newspaper archives in the library, local government archives, and published state and federal reports. U.S. "mass incarceration" and the "war on drugs" have been framed primarily as federal responses to deindustrialization driven by a racist backlash to expanded civil rights in the mid-twentieth century. This dissertation challenges that story, arguing instead that the long duree of carceral control and forced labor manifests as a core technique of market democracy. When land changes from "unused," to agriculturally productive, to industrial, to punitive, the laborers change with it: from Indigenous genocide and African (American) slavery, to Japanese-American "internees" in labor camps during WWII, to prison labor and devalued laborers with felonies, to undocumented agricultural laborers from Central and South America. Laborers during these changing eras, in turn, signify and at times foment social divisions especially along lines of race/ethnicity. Historicizing this relationship between privatized land and racialized labor locates “mass incarceration” as only a current manifestation of market democracy’s continual re/production of a racialized division of laborers.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAmerican studies. 4aAmerican history. 4aAfrican American studies.  a0296  a0323  a0343  a033720aPrinceton University.bAnthropology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342810104148nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002600159245009100185260005800276300001100334500007800345500004200423500002600465502004800491506006900539506005900608520267000667590002303337650002303360650002003383650002203403690000903425690000903434690000903443710004503452773005103497790000903548791001003557792000903567793001203576856015003588AAI1342811620191111131205.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060087  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428116  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12872  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWetzel, Joshua Lewis.10aStructure-aware Approaches for Deciphering Sequence-specific Protein-DNA Interactions. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a193 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Singh, Mona.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aInteractions between proteins and specific genomic loci are critical to the proper functioning of all cells. The ability of a DNA-binding protein (DBP) to distinguish between its target binding sites and other genomic regions is required for a myriad of crucial functions, including transcriptional regulation, meiotic recombination, chromatin remodeling, and genome organization. However, the fundamental relationship between the amino acid sequence of a DBP and its DNA-binding preferences remains largely elusive.High-throughput experimental technologies for detecting protein-DNA interactions have advanced substantially in the past decade and have enabled measurements for thousands of natural and synthetic DBP variants. However, these technologies typically require sophisticated analyses to uncover intrinsic DNA-binding specificities from the measured signals, often have poorly understood noise and sampling profiles, and provide little insight into the underlying mechanism of interaction. Meanwhile, precise co-complex structural data provide great insight into the mechanistic principles guiding interactions between DBPs and their DNA ligands, albeit at substantially lower throughput. These two types of data are complementary but rarely considered in concert.In this dissertation, I describe novel computational approaches that improve the accuracy and interpretability of inferences derived from high-throughput protein-DNA interaction data, via direct consideration of the underlying protein-DNA structural interaction interface shared across proteins within the same DNA-binding family. First, I describe a systematic exploration of the DNA-binding landscape for Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) proteins, the most abundant DNA-binding family in eukaryotes. Here we inferred the largest set of C2H2-ZF specificities to date and developed a state-of-the-art structurally-inspired method for predicting specificities for novel C2H2-ZFs. Second, I demonstrate how to leverage the large amounts of specificity data available for DBPs to develop a general framework that improves accuracy of high-throughput DNA-binding specificity inferences by jointly considering interaction preferences for groups of proteins from the same DNA-binding family, rewarding global consistency according to an expected similarity measure reflecting family-level structural considerations. Finally, I provide a probabilistic framework for improving interpretability of high-throughput data by mapping inferred specificities of DBPs from the same DNA-binding family onto a common "reference" structural interface model derived from aggregated family-level co-complex data.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aBioinformatics. 4aComputer science.  a0307  a0715  a098420aPrinceton University.bComputer Science.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342811603777nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001800159245009800177260005800275300001100333500007800344500004200422500003400464502004800498506005900546520231200605590002302917650001902940650001202959650002702971650001902998690000903017690000903026690000903035690000903044710006103053773005103114790000903165791001003174792000903184793001203193856015003205AAI1342818820191111131205.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060094  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428188  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12873  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aYang, Junnan.10aDesigning Deployment Policies to Maximize the Co-benefits of China's Clean Energy Transition. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a137 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Mauzerall, Denise L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aChina’s rapid economic growth over the past few decades has been fueled by the coal-dominated energy system. The increasing consumption of coal and other fossil fuels has resulted in a dramatic increase in China’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and worsening ambient air quality. The Chinese government has designed and implemented various deployment policies to support the transition toward significantly less coal and other fossil fuel consumption. My dissertation focuses on the climate, air quality, and industrial growth co-benefits of various deployment policies in China. It includes three analytical chapters.Chapter 2 analyzes the climate, air quality and human health benefits of various solar PV deployment scenarios in China in 2030. I find that deploying distributed PV in the east with inter-provincial transmission maximizes potential CO2 reductions and air quality-related health benefits. Deployment in the east with inter-provincial transmission results in the largest benefits because it maximizes displacement of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants and minimizes PV curtailment, which is more likely to occur without inter-provincial transmission.Chapter 3 analyzes the climate, air quality and human health implications of replacing small heating stoves with gas and electric heating in China. I examine the implications of using gas (conventional gas or coal-based synthetic natural gas (SNG)) and electricity (either resistance heaters or air-source heat pumps) for heating. I find deploying heat pumps as a substitute for small solid fuel stoves for heating has the greatest long-term potential of significant air quality and climate co-benefits as China further decarbonizes its power sector.Chapter 4 analyzes the role of deployment policies in promoting industrial growth in China’s wind, solar PV and Lithium-ion battery industries. I argue that deployment policies are effective to support industrial growth when the end uses of the clean energy technology are relatively few and concentrated. For battery storage technology, I find that there are multiple use cases of storage systems in the power sector, which makes direct subsidization for battery storage systems less effective in promoting the Li-ion battery industry compared to China's wind and solar industries.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPublic policy. 4aEnergy. 4aEnvironmental studies. 4aAsian studies.  a0477  a0630  a0791  a034220aPrinceton University.bPublic and International Affairs.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342818804602nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002500159245008500184260005800269300001100327500007800338500004200416500003400458502004800492506006900540506005900609520317900668590002303847650002203870650002903892690000903921690000903930710003603939773005103975790000904026791001004035792000904045793001204054856015004066AAI1342821420191111131205.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060100  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428214  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12874  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFraga, Sean Patrick.10aOcean Fever: Water, Trade, and the Shaping of the Terraqueous Pacific Northwest. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a401 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Sandweiss, Martha A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aAmerican interest in Asian trade propelled westward expansion and shaped the Pacific Northwest. In the early nineteenth century, Americans saw the Pacific Coast’s few harbors as portals between the continental interior and the Pacific Ocean, motivating westward expansion under presidents from Thomas Jefferson (who dispatched Lewis and Clark) to James Polk. Access to Pacific harbors structured Polk’s 1846 Oregon Treaty, which divided the Northwest between the United States and Great Britain. In the 1850s and 1860s, Euro-American settlers used steam-powered vessels to police indigenous people and enforce the region’s marine border during a volatile period that included the Stevens treaties, the 1856 Battle of Seattle, the 1858 Fraser River gold rush, and the 1859 Pig War, which started a years-long military standoff between the United States and Britain for control of the San Juan Islands. At the same time, cross-border trade drove support for American annexation of British Columbia. Between 1880 and 1910, four transcontinental railroads, part of an emergent global steam-powered transportation network, built to Northwest harbors to access Pacific trade. (These included Northern Pacific Railroad, Great Northern Railway, and Canadian Pacific Railway.) Boosters celebrated new connections to Asia, promoting Puget Sound as the "gateway to the Orient," even as other white Americans violently opposed the presence of Asian people. Maritime trade powered growth for port cities like Seattle and Tacoma, but brought problems like congested waterfronts and unsafe watercraft, inspiring a local strand of Progressivism to manage marine spaces for public benefit. In the twentieth century, water sustained Seattle’s suburban growth, as developers leveraged local connections provided by the mosquito fleet to build housing—steamboat suburbs, including one named Suquamish—on nearby rural waterfront land.Scholars generally describe American westward expansion in terrestrial terms, as a series of land acquisitions. This dissertation demonstrates that Americans also understood it as a terraqueous process, involving both terrestrial and aquatic areas. A terraqueous perspective on American history reveals that terrestrial stories are frequently entangled with aquatic spaces, "ungrounding" familiar narratives. This approach recovers the role of maritime workers in American territorial acquisition and settlement. It emphasizes the use of technology in border-making, demonstrating how Anglo-Americans used steamboats to counter indigenous maritime societies. It stresses the continuity between nineteenth-century American continental expansion and twentieth-century U.S. Pacific imperialism. And it models terraqueous possibilities for historical geography, showing how local maritime connections sustained urban and suburban growth. By revealing the terraqueous dimensions of American history, this research expands and challenges our understandings of American national incorporation, borders and borderlands, American engagement with the Pacific World, and urban and suburban development. American history looks different from the water’s edge.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aAmerican history. 4aBusiness administration.  a0337  a050520aPrinceton University.bHistory.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342821403412nam a2200349   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001700159245004800176260005800224300001100282500007800293500004200371500002700413502004800440506005900488520217600547590002302723650003002746690000902776710003602785773005102821790000902872791001002881792000902891793001202900856015002912AAI1342829120191111131206.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060117  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428291  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12875  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSun, Jiming.10aHigh Pressure Superionic Ice Phase Diagram. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a125 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Car, Roberto.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aWater is one of the most common substances in the universe and is found in many different phases. At extremely high temperature and pressure, water ice forms a superionic phase (SI) in which the water molecules dissociate into ions, with the oxygen ions forming a crystal lattice structure and the hydrogen ions flowing through the lattice like a liquid. In this thesis, we present a first-principle study of the high pressure superionic ice phase. We systematically explore the superionic phase diagram and carefully study its physical and chemical properties. As a result of this investigation, we find that superionic ice exists in three different phases differentiating from each other in the structure of the oxygen sublattice. One phase is the BCC-SI phase, which has BCC oxygen sublattice and has been predicted by several groups. We find the BCC-SI phase is stable up to about 250GPa. At higher pressure, BCC-SI transforms via a first order transition to the CP-SI phase. The oxygens form close-packed structures in this phase. CP-SI has also been predicted by other authors, though our predicted transition pressure is significantly higher. Finally, we find a third SI phase, P21/c-SI, which would exist at even higher pressure and it is predicted here for the first time. In addition, we use the imaginary-time path integral technique to study the nuclear quantum effects (NQE). We find the NQE changes the SI ice phase boundaries significantly. Compared to the classical results, NQE makes CP-SI phase more stable and increases the transition pressure from about 1.5TPa to about 1.7TPa. We show that the NQE on the SI phase boundary can be explained by thermodynamic perturbation theory to the lowest order. Lastly, we studied the chemical bonding and the electronic structures of high pressure superionic phases. We computed the distribution of maximally localized Wannier functions centers and showed evidence that the chemical bonding in high pressure ice phases is dominated by ionic interactions. This is very different from the low pressure phases, where the water molecules are intact and the intermolecular interactions are dominated by hydrogen bonds.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aCondensed matter physics.  a061120aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342829103895nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001700159245010300176260005800279300001100337500007800348500004200426500002700468502004800495506005900543520248900602590002303091650002903114650002503143650002303168690000903191690000903200690000903209710003803218773005103256790000903307791001003316792000903326793001203335856015003347AAI1342841920191111131206.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060124  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428419  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12876  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKo, Hsin-Yu.10aFirst-Principles Study on the Structural and Thermal Properties of Molecular Crystals and Liquids. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a190 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Car, Roberto.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHybrid density functional theory (DFT) is widely used to obtain a semi-quantitative understanding of the electronic structures of isolated molecular clusters; however, it has limited applicability to large molecules and complex condensed-phase materials due to its high computational cost. To overcome this difficulty, a linear-scaling algorithm based on maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF) can be employed.In the first part of this thesis, we present a detailed discussion on the theory, real-space implementation, and performance of this algorithm for enabling large-scale condensed-phase hybrid DFT based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations under realistic isobaric-isothermal (NpT) conditions. For the theory aspect, we discuss how the MLWF-based linear-scaling approach can be integrated into the Car-Parrinello AIMD framework. For our implementation (named exx module), we introduced several features to enable massive parallelization using hybrid MPI/OpenMP technologies, including custom data distribution scheme for MLWFs, static load balancing algorithm, and reusable proto-subdomains to exploit the localization in MLWF representation. Based on performance test using realistic condensed-phase liquid water systems (H2O)64, (H 2O)128, and (H2O)256, we find the  exx module to be quite efficient and scalable, hence making a hybrid DFT based AIMD simulation feasible.In the second part, we apply the exx module to study molecular crystals and liquids. The first application is to simulate the ice I h, II, and III phases using AIMD at the dispersion-inclusive hybrid DFT level at their experimental triple point (238 K, 2.1 kbar). In the second application, we exploit the computational efficiency and scalability of our  exx module in conjunction with leadership level supercomputers to perform path-integral AIMD (PI-AIMD) simulations on liquid water (300 K) and ice Ih (273 K) both under ambient pressure (1.0 bar) at dispersion-inclusive hybrid DFT level. We identify this level of theory provides a quite accurate description to water. From the resulting trajectory, we also find that the nuclear quantum fluctuation with autoprotolysis-type distortion promotes orbital localization. In the third application, we explore how anharmonicity, nuclear quantum effects (NQE), many-body dispersion interactions, and Pauli repulsion influence thermal properties of dispersion-bound molecular crystals using pyridine and similar organic molecular crystals.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aComputational chemistry. 4aMolecular chemistry. 4aMaterials science.  a0219  a0431  a079420aPrinceton University.bChemistry.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342841904733nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002800159245011900187260005800306300001000364500007800374500004200452500002600494502004800520506005900568520325700627590002303884650001403907650002003921650001603941650001403957690000903971690000903980690000903989690000903998710006304007773005104070790000904121791001004130792000904140793001204149856015004161AAI1342842020191111131206.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060131  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428420  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12877  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZamalloa, Jose Antonio.10aPrediction of Cancer Phenotypes Through Machine Learning Approaches: From Gene Modularity to Deep Neural Networks. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a94 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Singh, Mona.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe current genomics data influx is transforming healthcare by enabling precise diagnoses and individualized treatments. This is especially true for cancer, where we have genome sequencing and gene expression data across numerous individuals, along with measurements of drug response across hundreds of cancer cell lines. Computational, statistical and machine learning methods play an essential role in analyzing these data in order to gain medically relevant insights. In this dissertation, I describe statistical and machine learning approaches to enable better stratification of cancer subtypes and predict therapy outcomes for individuals with cancer.First, I introduce Deep Pharmacogenomic Modules (Deep-PGMs), a framework to predict drug response outcomes for tumor samples using drug features and gene expression data. Genome expression signatures are a great aid for predicting whether a particular therapy may be beneficial for a specific cancer tumor. Traditional ma- chine learning approaches to predict the effect of a cancer drug on a tumor typically focus on the expression levels of either certain key cancer-relevant genes or of all genes. While genomic data can aid in describing the disease state of an individual by looking at isolated gene entities, genes in cells tend to act in concert to perform their functions. My approach takes advantage of the modular nature of gene regulation to build a reduced feature space that describes the cellular state of a tumor. I take advantage of unsupervised machine learning methods to build genomic and non-genomic feature spaces. I construct a deep neural network pipeline to predict drug efficacy outcomes on tumor cell line samples. I demonstrate that my framework outperforms traditional machine learning approaches that do not take advantage of the modular structure of gene expression data sets. I further apply my method to clinical trial data and demonstrate its performance. I find that featurizing genomic data through prior knowledge about cellulary modularity, accompanied with a robust deep learning pipeline, is a powerful method for predicting the disease outcome of novel cancer therapeutics.In the second part of my thesis, I develop classifiers to identify two breast cancer subtypes. First, I describe an accurate Claudin-low (CL) molecular subtype predictor based on gene expression data. This particular subtype has poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Via experiments in mice along with analysis of human breast cancer data, my collaborators and I linked individuals with CL breast cancer to elevated levels of miR-199a. This evidence further supported the high levels of miR-199a in mice tumors and helped characterize the miR-199a-LCOR-IFN axis in tumor initiation. Next, I developed a hysteretic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) classifier. I use experimental data from TGF-β induced EMT mouse mammary tumor cells to find genes that are indicative of the hysteretic EMT phenotype. The uncovered genes in my model correlate well with metastatic phenotypes in clinical datasets, particularly in patients with metastatic lung cancer, suggesting that EMT-induced mice mammary tumor cells can help elucidate clinically relevant genes important in metastasis.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aGenetics. 4aBioinformatics. 4aPhysiology. 4aOncology.  a0369  a0715  a0719  a099220aPrinceton University.bQuantitative Computational Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342842004443nam a2200349   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001500159245010600174260005800280300001100338500007800349500004200427500003500469502004800504506005900552520315300611590002303764650001603787690000903803710004003812773005103852790000903903791001003912792000903922793001203931856015003943AAI1342844820191111131206.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060148  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428448  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12878  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWu, Wenbo.10aShort Period Body Waves Unveil Deep Earth's Small-Scale Structure: From a Subducted Slab to the Core. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a182 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Irving, Jessica C.

Seismic imaging can provide critical constraints on its thermochemical state. Although great progress has been made on large-scale seismic imaging, imaging small-scale structures is more difficult due to more complex wave propagation effects for short period waves. In this dissertation, I investigate several types of short period signals traveling in the deep Earth and use their properties to constrain the structure in Earth's inner core, outer core and the subducted oceanic crust of the Pacific plate beneath NE Japan.Strong small-scale (a few km) volumetric heterogeneities in the inner core have been detected using short period (∼1 s) inner core scattering (ICS), termed PKiKP coda, in previous studies. However, most of these data sampled the inner core's "eastern hemisphere". I observed PKiKP and its coda waves sampling the "western hemisphere" and confirmed small-scale heterogeneities in the inner core's "western hemisphere". However, the ICS from "western hemisphere" is weaker than that from the "eastern hemisphere". This hemispherical difference, or a regional variation, is also seen other properties of the inner core, such as anisotropy and average compressional wave velocity, Vp.Previous studies of body waves have imaged a low Vp layer at the top of outer core indicating a stratified layer. To better resolve this low Vp layer, I developed a novel approach using array data to iteratively isolate individual SmKS (m = 3, 4 and 5) signals and better measured SmKS-SKKS differential travel times. I successfully used this method to measure SmKS travel time delays. I also applied this iterative scheme on SPECFEM3D globe synthetic SmKS seismograms to investigate the effects of 3D mantle structure. The results indicate that 3D mantle structure effects are not negligible in our data and could bias the estimation of Vp in the uppermost outer core. After 3D mantle structure corrections, there are still substantial time delays for supporting a low Vp at the top of Earth's outer core, relative to the PREM.Subducted oceanic crust plays an important role in material recycling (e.g. water) and the genesis of seismicity. Oceanic crust is usually thinner than 10 km and difficult to image. I observed seismic multi-pathing effects in the subduction zone below NE Japan. These multi-pathing effects are controlled by a seismic attenuation contrast between the back-arc mantle wedge and subducted crust. I used an oceanic crust model based on mineral-physics and conducted SPECFEM2D numerical simulations to investigate these multi-pathing effects. My results support a 9% Vp increase in the oceanic crust at a depth of 130–150 km due to the (lawsonite, talc)-eclogite transition.Here I demonstrated three examples of using short period body waves to image deep Earth's small-scale structure. A large amount of short period data accumulated in the last decades is still awaiting seismological analysis. Deciphering these signals will tremendously improve our understanding of small-scale structure in the deep Earth.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aGeophysics.  a037320aPrinceton University.bGeosciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342844803324nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002000159245007400179260005800253300001100311500007800322500004200400500002800442502004800470506006700518506005900585520187900644590002302523650002102546650001602567650002302583690000902606690000902615690000902624710004002633773005102673790000902724791001002733792000902743793001202752856015002764AAI1342846220191111131207.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060155  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428462  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12879  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSmith, James A.10aSeismic Imaging of Underground Tunnels Using Full-Waveform Inversion. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a180 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Tromp, Jeroen.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThere are a variety of challenges when applying full-waveform inversion to underground tunnels in the near-surface. One challenge is in efficiently handling large amounts of seismic data on high-performance computing machines. Big data-sets allow for more measurements to be made that can resolve structures at unprecedented resolution. Utilizing these data-sets in seismic inversion work-flows requires developing new technologies that are fast, adaptable, and reproducible. The adaptable seismic data format (ASDF) is a modern data format that offers an organized, standards-based, and provenance-enhanced tool for earthquake seismology.A second challenge is generating accurate three-dimensional images of small subsurface voids near the surface. In advancing seismic imaging in the near-surface regime, three-dimensional elastic full-waveform inversion is applied to a known underground tunnel located in a desert geology at a depth of approximately 10 m. A set of successful experiments are presented that approximately image the underground tunnel in three-dimensions.A third challenge is in estimating the source time function from field data. Since the recorded data includes the effect of the source, the more accurate the estimate of the seismic source, the more accurate the model of the inverted subsurface velocity structure. A linear inversion method is applied for inverting for the source time signature from recorded sensor data. The inverted source is verified by comparing it with the measured accelerometer data from the field site.A fourth challenge is in incorporating anelastic attenuation into the inversion workflow. The range of possible parameter values for attenuation are constrained using the recorded data from the tunnel site. A set of 2D numerical experiments are presented that invert for attenuation directly in acoustic and elastic media.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aApplied physics. 4aGeophysics. 4aCivil engineering.  a0215  a0373  a054320aPrinceton University.bGeosciences.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342846203820nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002000159245005500179260005800234300001100292500007800303500004200381500002700423502004800450506006900498506006700567506005900634520229600693590002302989650003003012650002303042650002803065690000903093690000903102690000903111710003703120773005103157790000903208791001003217792000903227793001203236856015003248AAI1342861820191111131207.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060162  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428618  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12880  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aEnamorado, Ted.10aEssays on Data Integration in the Social Sciences. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a166 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Imai, Kosuke.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation is a collection of three essays that deal with the challenges social scientists face when trying to integrate information from multiple sources.The first chapter focuses on technical aspects of data integration. Specifically, when a unique identifier that unambiguously links records is not available, merging datasets can be a difficult task. Probabilistic record linkage (PRL) aims to solve this problem by providing a principled framework. I propose an active learning algorithm for PRL, which incorporates human judgment. Using data where a unique identifier is available for validation, I find that the proposed method bolsters the accuracy of the merging process. In addition, I show that the proposed method can recover estimates that are indistinguishable from those obtained from a more extensive and time-consuming manual review.The second chapter uses data from multiple sources to study the impact of electoral rules on coalition building. To overcome endogeneity concerns, I exploit an arbitrary change in electoral rules across municipalities in Brazil and study its impact on pre-electoral coalitions (PECs). I find that in municipalities where elections are conducted using a dual-ballot system, the median number of parties in a given PEC is smaller than in those municipalities that use a single-ballot system. In addition, this reduction in the size of PECs is associated with an increase in the total number of candidates. These findings are consistent with theories that emphasize the opportunities for strategic behavior under a dual-ballot system.Finally, the third chapter (co-authored with Svetlana Kosterina) combines information from multiple sources to study ethnic voting. We show that local ethnic geography affects ethnic voting by incentivizing voters of an ethnicity that finds itself in the minority to misrepresent its preferences. We provide empirical evidence for our claim using the data from the Afrobarometer survey in Ghana to measure the voters' beliefs that they are likely to face adverse consequences for expressing their political preferences. Using geocoded data from Afrobarometer, as well as data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, we find no evidence for local public goods provision as an alternative mechanism.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aSocial studies education. 4aPolitical science. 4aInformation technology.  a0489  a0534  a061520aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342861803727nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002400159245007800183260005800261300001100319500007800330500004200408500003400450502004800484506006900532506006700601506005900668520224400727590002302971650001602994650002303010690000903033690000903042710003703051773005103088790000903139791001003148792000903158793001203167856015003179AAI1342863420191111131207.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060179  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428634  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12882  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHulme Kozey, Emily.10aPhilosophia and Philotechnia: The Techne Theme in the Platonic Dialogues. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a212 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Wildberg, Christian.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  a"Good God! You never shut up about cobblers and fullers and cooks and doctors!" So Callicles charges Plato's Socrates with an excessive fascination with the τϵχνη in the Gorgias (491a). Callicles certainly has a point: Plato refers to τϵχνη ("art," "craft," "profession," "expertise") hundreds of times in the dialogues, while also portraying Socrates as a former δημι oυργoς ("craftsman," "professional") himself (Alc. 1.121a; Euthphr. 11c).In my dissertation, I examine the philosophical importance of τϵχνη in Plato. The first part discusses the idea of τϵχνη in the wider Greek world of the fifth and fourth centuries. Chapter one shows how Plato connects Socrates with the god of craft, Hephaistos, and how this is related to the Athenian setting of the dialogues. The second chapter uses literary, art historical, and epigraphic sources to identify four major features of a τϵχνη: (I) connection with low social status; (II) teachability; (III) specialization; (IV) rationality.The second part of the dissertation turns to Plato proper. The third chapter examines the important question of how Plato's terms for crafts, knowledge, learning, and professions are structured. Contrary to previous work that has asserted the equivalence of τϵχνη and ϵπιστημη, I argue that ϵπιστημη picks up on the teachable, intellectual component of τϵχνη. Against a common misconception, I argue that the opposite of τϵχνη for Plato is not ϵμπϵιρια ("experience," "practice") but παρϵργoν ("hobby") and that this contrast, and the one made by the terms for the individuals who pursue each of these (δημιoυργ oς/ιδιωτης, "professional"/ "amateur"), is central to Plato's conception of what makes something a true τϵχνη. For Plato, mere book knowledge will not be enough: extensive practice or experience is, in fact, an absolute requirement for true mastery of a given field. The fourth and fifth chapters then turn to this theme in two related contexts. First, I assess how Plato portrays the sophists as practitioners of pseudo-τϵχναι; and then, in the final chapter, I turn to the Republic, where philosophy itself is construed as a τϵχνη.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhilosophy. 4aClassical studies.  a0422  a043420aPrinceton University.bClassics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342863403208nam a2200421   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002300159245008800182260005800270300001100328500007800339500004200417500003100459502004800490506006900538506006700607506005900674520168500733590002302418650001502441650001502456650000902471690000902480690000902489690000902498710003802507773005102545790000902596791001002605792000902615793001202624856015002636AAI1380542720191111131207.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060186  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13805427  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12883  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSybblis, Martin W.10aOpen for Business: A Socio-Legal Analysis of Economic Development in the Caribbean. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a296 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Scheppele, Kim L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation offers a novel way to understand how legal change occurs in the corporate and commercial context. It suggests that legal professionals, particularly commercial lawyers, are capable of enhancing the state's capacity for law reform in instances where legal rules are seen as a pathway to economic prosperity. They and other community leaders (typically political and business elites), however, are influenced in their reform efforts by the community economic identities ("CEIs") they have developed with respect to chosen commercial activities within their jurisdiction. CEIs affect how those who make the crucial development decisions think about the commercial activities and industries in their community (city, state, country or region), and these identities in turn shape what seem like logical choices for that community.This project makes two contributions to the sociology of law and economic development. First, it suggests that the scholarly understanding of "state capacity" should be expanded to include the availability and role of private sector commercial lawyers who can help a state promote and achieve commercial law reforms. Second, the dissertation introduces the concept of CEI into the academic discourse on the relationship between law and economic development. It explores the role commercial lawyers and CEI have played in commercial law reform in the Commonwealth Caribbean post-colonies of Barbados and Jamaica. The institutional similarities between the two countries and the divergent paths they have taken in their approach to commercial law reform make them attractive sites for better understanding the determinants of legal change.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aEconomics. 4aSociology. 4aLaw.  a0501  a0626  a039820aPrinceton University.bSociology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380542703333nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002200159245008900181260005800270300001100328500007800339500004200417500002900459502004800488506006900536506005900605520184300664590002302507650002302530650002102553650002002574690000902594690000902603690000902612710006102621773005102682790000902733791001002742792000902752793001202761856015002773AAI1380543120191111131207.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060193  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13805431  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12884  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBalloni, Massimo.10aFor an Encyclopedia of the Living: Collective Creativity and the Early Soviet Novel. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a217 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Vinitsky, Ilya.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe goal of this dissertation is to consider the collective literary practices of the first fifteen years of the Soviet Union in order to suggest a shift in the proletariat from object to author of its own narrative discourse and identify the aesthetic strategies that made such a transition possible. In this sense, collective creativity became one of the most debated devices of its time. By looking at the novel as a large case study, I show how this literary genre had to be rethought to depict the new social order and accommodate the proletariat as the new protagonist in the historical process. As an overarching metaphor, I deploy a variation of the old dualism between the universal and the particular understood more technically, however, as reproducibility vs specificity. To lay bare this shift in the narrative discourse of the proletariat, I investigate the process by which, in the novel, the chaotic crowds of the Revolutionary years gained proletarian consciousness and became masses charged with building Communism. I trace the trajectory that leads from the collapse of the biography of the Civil War hero to History of Factories and Plants, a series of volumes in which the divide between the professional writer and the proletarian worker has been erased, the biography of the collective is narrated, and a Soviet epos is created. While, on the narrative level, war and the machine functioned as the main organizing principles of the crowd in the first decade following the Revolution, literary practice itself became the ultimate organizer of the collective in the early 1930s. Far from being antithetical to the cult of personality prominent in the Stalinist years, it is precisely these collective endeavors that, I claim, laid the groundwork for the poetics of Socialist Realism and the advent of the Soviet Hero.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aSlavic literature. 4aRussian history. 4aSlavic studies.  a0314  a0614  a072420aPrinceton University.bSlavic Languages and Literatures.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380543103753nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001900159245008600178260005800264300001100322500007800333500004200411500002800453502004800481506005900529520241800588590002303006650002803029650001203057690000903069690000903078710005103087773005103138790000903189791001003198792000903208793001203217856015003229AAI1380609320191111131208.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060209  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13806093  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12886  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhang, Jintao.10aExploring Mixed-Signal Computation for Energy Aggressive Interface Architectures. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a133 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Verma, Naveen.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aEmbedded sensor signals from an increasing variety of sources are enabling a broad range of intelligent systems. For instance, the systems aim to gain information about the state of the world, including its human inhabitants. However, the extraction of such information from embedded signals is challenging, since the signals naturally arise from complex physics of real-world processes. Machine-learning algorithms are addressing this challenge by enabling the construction of models for inferences from such complex signals, by using the data themselves. A key focus thus becomes the realization of such algorithms in highly energy-constrained sensing devices, despite the increasing compute complexity of the algorithms. In energy-constrained systems, a conventional way to resolve this problem is to employ application-specific circuits.In this thesis, we have proposed using mixed-signal computation within unconventional architectures to overcome fundamental limitations that are faced in traditional digital application-specific architectures. But to maximize energy efficiency, the new architectures must avoid overheads typically incurred to correct mixed-signal circuit non-idealities. In order to maintain high overall system level performance, we also exploit the machine-learning approach of Data-Driven Hardware Resilience (DDHR), which involves statistical learning using data processed by the non-ideal circuits themselves, such that the machine-learning model optimally adapts to the non-idealities. This leads to substantial hardware-level relaxation and thus the potential for highly efficient system implementations.To demonstrate our ideas, multiple hardware designs that are tested via silicon-CMOS prototypes are demonstrated. We first present a Time-domain Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) accelerator, to show the idea of DDHR in an embedded seizure detection system when overcoming analog non-idealities. Then, a SAR-ADC based matrix multiplier, referred to as the Matrix-Multiplying ADC (MMADC), is demonstrated as an example for mixed-signal computing. Then, an SRAM-based strong classifier (ClassRAM) is demonstrated. Further, system-level trade-offs and specialized algorithms are analyzed and developed, based on the in-memory architecture extended from ClassRAM, which enhance the application-level computational scalability of the architectures.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aElectrical engineering. 4aEnergy.  a0544  a079120aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380609303857nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002100159245005100180260005800231300001100289500007800300500004200378500003000420502004800450506005900498520255500557590002303112650001603135650002203151690000903173690000903182710005103191773005103242790000903293791001003302792000903312793001203321856015003333AAI1380666320191111131208.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060216  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13806663  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12887  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLiu, Changchang.10aRethinking the Science of Statistical Privacy. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a203 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Mittal, Prateek.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aNowadays, more and more data, such as social network data, mobility data, business data, medical data, are shared or made public to enable real world applications. Such data is likely to contain sensitive information and thus needs to be obfuscated prior to release, to protect privacy. However, existing statistical data privacy mechanisms in the security community have several weaknesses: 1) they are limited in protecting sensitive information in the static scenario, and can not be generally applied to accommodate temporal dynamics. With the increasing development of data science, a large amount of sensitive data such as personal social relationships are becoming public, making the privacy concerns of a time series of data more and more challenging; 2) these privacy mechanisms do not explicitly capture correlations, leaving open the possibility of inference attacks. In many real world scenarios, the data tuple dependence/ correlation occurs naturally in datasets due to social, behavioral and genetic interactions between users; 3) there are very few practical guidelines on how to apply existing statistical privacy notions in practice, and a key challenge is how to set an appropriate value for the privacy parameters.In this thesis, we aim to overcome these weaknesses to provide privacy guarantees for protecting dynamic data structures, dependent (correlated) data structures. We also aim to discover useful and interpretable guidelines for selecting proper values of parameters in the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving frameworks. Furthermore, we investigate how an auxiliary information—in the form of prior distribution of the database and correlation across records and time—can influence the proper choice of the privacy parameters. Specifically, we 1) first propose the design of a privacy-preserving system called LinkMirage, that mediates access to dynamic social relationships in social networks, while effectively supporting social graph-based data analytics; 2) explicitly incorporate structural properties of data into current differential privacy metrics and mechanisms, to enable privacy-preserving data analytics for dependent/correlated data; and 3) finally provide a quantitative analysis of how hypothesis testing can guide the choice of the privacy parameters in an interpretable manner for differential privacy and other statistical privacy frameworks.Overall, our work aims to place the field of statistical data privacy on a firm analytic foundation that is coupled with the design of practical systems.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aStatistics. 4aComputer science.  a0463  a098420aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380666303442nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002500159245006400184260005800248300001100306500007800317500004200395500002800437502004800465506006900513506006700582506005900649520202800708590002302736650001802759690000902777710004102786773005102827790000902878791001002887792000902897793001202906856015002918AAI1380674020191111131208.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060223  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13806740  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12888  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aVannucchi, Federica.10aA Disciplinary Mechanism: The Milan Triennale, 1964–1973. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a442 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Allais, Lucia.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation traces the reform of architecture as a discipline in postwar Italy by examining one particular public institution in which architecture, its theorists, and its designers, directly confronted both public and political power: the Milan Triennale (officially known as the International Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Architecture). In the 1960s and early 1970s, the dissertation argues, the Milan Triennale functioned as a "disciplinary mechanism," that is, as a laboratory and testing ground for reshaping the relationship of architecture in both its theoretical and practical dimensions to politics. This relationship to power is examined through the lens of the tension between ideas presented at the exhibition and the nature of the Milanese institution as both executor of government resolutions and agent of the public's will. Against the backdrop of Italy's first abrupt period of economic unrest after World War Two, an interruption in the politics of centrismo (the center-right coalition that dominated Italy from 1947 to 1962), uprisings by students and workers, and the onset of a new era of reformism, the curators of three seminal exhibitions tested architecture as a means of political resistance against power and thereby refused to comply with the long-standing alliance between the Milan Triennale and the government. The exhibitions Tempo libero (Leisure) (1964) curated by Umberto Eco and Vittorio Gregotti, Grande numero (Greater Number) (1968) curated by Giancarlo De Carlo, and Architettura-citta  (Architecture-City) (1973) curated by Aldo Rossi led to a new understanding of architecture as a discipline that existed both "within and against" political power, to borrow an expression coined by neo-Marxist philosopher Mario Tronti. This dissertation follows the struggles of architects and critics as they operated "within" an institutional setting that was to endow their ideas with greater power, but also declared themselves as being "against" this very power structure.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aArchitecture.  a072920aPrinceton University.bArchitecture.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380674003441nam a2200349   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001700159245003500176260005800211300001100269500007800280500004200358500002800400502004800428506005900476520218400535590002302719650002502742690000902767710007402776773005102850790000902901791001002910792000902920793001202929856015002941AAI1380675820191111131208.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060230  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13806758  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12889  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWang, Peiqi.10aFinite State Mean Field Games. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a222 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Carmona, Rene.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMean field game is a powerful framework for studying the strategic interactions within a large population of rational agents. Although existing research has predominantly relied on diffusion models to depict agents' states, numerous applications, such as epidemic control and botnet defense, can best be modeled by systems of particles in discrete state space. This thesis tackles finite state mean field games. In the first part of the thesis, we develop a probabilistic approach for finite state mean field games. Based on the weak formulation of optimal control, the approach accommodates the interactions through the players' strategies and flexible information structures.The second part of the thesis is devoted to finite state mean field games involving a player possessing dominating influence. Two different mechanisms are explored. We first study a form of Stackelberg games, in which the dominating player, referred to as principal, moves first and chooses its strategy which impacts the dynamics and objective functions of every remaining player, referred to as agent. Having observed the principal's strategy, the agents reach a Nash equilibrium. We seek optimal strategies of the principal, whose objective function depends on the statistical distribution of the agents' states in equilibrium. Using the weak formulation of finite state mean field games developed previously in the thesis, we transform the principal's optimization problem into a McKean-Vlasov control problem, and provide a semi-explicit solution under the assumptions of linear transition rate, quadratic cost and risk-neutral utility.In the second model, we assume that all players move simultaneously and we study Nash equilibria formed jointly by major and minor players. We introduce finite player games and derive mean field game formulation in the limit of infinitely many minor players. In this limit, we characterize the best responses of major and minor players via viscosity solutions of HJB equations, and we prove existence of Nash equilibria under reasonable assumptions. We also derive approximate Nash equilibria for the finite player game from the solution of the mean field game.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aApplied mathematics.  a036420aPrinceton University.bOperations Research and Financial Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380675803440nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002400159245011800183260005800301300001100359500007800370500004200448500002800490502004800518506005900566520205700625590002302682650002802705650002302733690000902756690000902765710005102774773005102825790000902876791001002885792000902895793001202904856015002916AAI1380682420191111131208.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060247  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13806824  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12891  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKerner, Ross Allen.10aChemistry of Lead Halide Perovskites: Aspects of Solution-Gelation and Acid-Base Reactions with Aliphatic Amines. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a138 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Rand, Barry P.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMetal halide perovskites are an exciting and promising class of materials for optoelectronic device applications. Advancement of perovskite photovoltaic and light emitting diode lab-scale efficiencies have increased to or exceeded the performance of many established semiconductor technologies, but on a much shorter time scale. The rapid evolution of halide perovskite technology owes largely to the knowledge base gained from previous thin film technologies as well as a large amount of empirical improvements in processing and device architecture. However, there exist several barriers to commercialization of halide perovskites, mainly, long-term material stability and device operation. These challenges stem from the strong chemical reactivity of halide perovskite materials. Reactions taking place in solution while processing and in the solid-state during device fabrication/characterization lead to many complications and potentially obfuscate interpretation of results. These unique properties also make perovskites a rich platform by which to study many interesting and novel photo-electrochemical phenomena. In this thesis, we study the chemical properties of halide perovskites elucidating aspects of solution-gelation chemistry, the effect of stoichiometry on nano-scale composition, acid-base reactions with simple additives in solution, and solid-state reduction-oxidation reactions influencing electrochemical stability. Fundamental insight gained from these detailed studies facilitate significant improvements targeting specific applications such as fabricating ultrasmooth, ultrathin perovskite films with high emissivity and exploiting impurity chemistry at optimal concentrations leading to defect passivation. These results demonstrate the benefits of identifying chemical reaction mechanisms relevant to halide perovskites. Understanding and predicting how perovskites will react with other material systems and conditions is paramount for progressing the field and overcoming challenges to commercialization of this technology.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aElectrical engineering. 4aMaterials science.  a0544  a079420aPrinceton University.bElectrical Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380682403669nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002200159245002200181260005800203300001100261500007800272500004200350500004400392502004800436506006900484506005900553520231800612590002302930650001902953650001802972690000902990690000902999710003403008773005103042790000903093791001003102792000903112793001203121856015003133AAI1380705320191111131209.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060254  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13807053  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12892  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPhillips, Reuben.10aBrahms as Reader. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a289 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Agawu, V.

Drawing on archival research undertaken in Vienna, I argue that Brahms's early aesthetic worldview was fundamentally shaped by his devotion to reading. The later chapters of the dissertation draw on key works of German Romantic literature to contextualize two of Brahms's singular offerings in the fields of chamber music and song.Part 1 provides the first comprehensive investigation of an important source for evidence of Brahms's early reading habits: his notebooks of literary quotations known—since their abridged publication in 1909—as Des jungen Kreislers Schatzkastlein. Chapter 1 situates Brahms's quotation collection in three contexts, considering biographical representations of Brahms as a reader, the role played by Robert Schumann in shaping Brahms's literary enthusiasms, and the elevated status afforded to the activity of reading in German culture of the mid nineteenth century. Chapter 2 provides a thematic summary of the notebook entries, suggesting that for Brahms the process of copying out quotations served as a means of meditating on important ideas about the role of art in society, genius, originality, and artistic technique. An appendix provides a transcription of surviving source materials from copies preserved in the Wienbibliothek im Rathaus.In the second part of the dissertation I enlist some of Brahms's beloved works of German Romantic literature in the examination of two compositions from the 1860s: the Trio for Piano, Violin, and Waldhorn, op. 40, and the Magelone Romanzen, op. 33. Following the lead of early critics, Chapter 3 considers the Horn Trio from the perspectives of affect and musical temporality in relation to the literary topos  of the Romantic horn call. Chapter 4 offers a literary and music-analytical account of the Magelone Romanzen, homing in on Brahms's formally innovative treatment of Tieck's poetic texts. By exploring these works as imaginative musical responses to themes and motifs central to the literature of German Romanticism, this pair of close readings demonstrates some of the ways in which Brahms's youthful reading fed his mature creativity.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMusic history. 4aMusic theory.  a0208  a022120aPrinceton University.bMusic.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380705303562nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002900159245008200188260005800270300001100328500007800339500004200417500003400459502004800493506006900541506005900610520209500669590002302764650002302787650001602810650002102826690000902847690000902856690000902865710003702874773005102911790000902962791001002971792000902981793001202990856015003002AAI1380714720191111131209.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060261  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13807147  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12893  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPetkas, Alexander James.10aSynesius of Cyrene and the Politics of the Late Antique Philosophical Letter. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a311 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Wildberg, Christian.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation is a study of the Greek letter collection of Synesius of Cyrene (ca. 370–415 AD) as the key to his literary oeuvre; I argue that the epistles were a project of political philosophy. Synesius was a Neoplatonist philosopher, student of Hypatia of Alexandria, and eventually became the Metropolitan Bishop of Libya. His letters attest to a community of philosophical friends spread across Libya, Egypt, Syria, and Constantinople, a group which included both pagans and Christians. Synesius' letters drew on a philosophical epistolary tradition which can be meaningfully traced back to Plato and Isocrates in 4th century B.C. Athens. His epistles, like those of near contemporaries Gregory of Nazianzus and emperor Julian, participate in the public culture of the so-called Second Sophistic of the high Roman empire, a context still relevant in the late antique east. Contemporary Neoplatonic philosophers such as Julian, Themistius, Syrianus, and Eunapius would have seen political philosophy as an applied, or practical, activity, in which the deployment of rhetoric for the good of the state was central. In carrying out his political philosophy, Synesius tried to promote the honor, or value, of his own version of philosophy against competing alternatives, especially various forms of Christian asceticism. His letters construct for his community an alternative imaginary space built on classical topography, as an alternative to the late antique city. Synesius' learned classicism was driven by moral and philosophical imperatives attested in other writings of his, and was an earnest response to his unique late antique situation, which included Evagrius of Pontus and the Origenist controversy. Letters from his episcopacy show his attempt to reimagine contemporary realities in classical terms, as he points out continuities where others see change, and contradictions where others see harmony. His letters thus illuminate the values and preoccupations of a less known but important sector of late antique Hellenic society, in which Hypatia was an important player.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aClassical studies. 4aPhilosophy. 4aAncient history.  a0294  a0422  a057920aPrinceton University.bClassics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380714703826nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100003200159245011400191260005800305300001100363500007800374500004200452500003000494502004800524506006900572506006700641506005900708520230800767590002303075650001903098650001803117690000903135690000903144710003403153773005103187790000903238791001003247792000903257793001203266856015003278AAI1380718020191111131209.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060278  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13807180  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12894  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMatthay, Christopher David.14aThe Classical-period Development Section: Compositional Strategies of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a428 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Agawu, Victor K.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe development section has been described as the most characteristic feature of Classical-period sonata form, as that which distinguishes sonata form from related forms of the period. It has been called "the locus of variety and motion," "the appointed field for the tournament of tonalities," and, borrowing from dramatic theory, "the intrigue," or "the knot." Its function has been described variously as that of unfolding, elaboration, intensification, and digression. Of the three parts of sonata form, the development is, both tonally and in its treatment of thematic material, the least predictable and the most variable from work to work.This dissertation explores rhetorical and harmonic strategies of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert for beginning and ending the development, and, in Mozart's early sonata-form movements, for structuring the development as a whole. The project engages with the recent theories of Classical-Period form developed by William Caplin and by James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy; with the less schematic approaches to form of Charles Rosen, Leonard Ratner, and Donald Francis Tovey; and with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century theories of form and of harmony, including those of Riepel, Koch, Reicha, Marx, and Riemann. The approach taken attempts to balance taxonomy and interpretation, and is especially concerned to describe the effects produced by the given strategies in their various realizations in particular works.Chapter 1 describes a beginning strategy often used by Beethoven in his piano sonatas, that of opening the development with a transformed, "dissolving" statement of the work's main theme. Chapter 2 explores a contrasting strategy used by Mozart in several of his middle- and late-period works, a strategy of beginning the development with a tight-knit new theme. Chapters 3 and 4 describe modulatory pathways used in High-Classical-period works to lead out of the key of the end of the exposition, and Chapters 5 and 6 describe retransitional strategies in sonata-form movements of the 1760s–1770s and 1780s–1810s, respectively. Chapter 7 describes three of Mozart's strategies for structuring the development as a whole in his early sonata-form movements, and compares these with related strategies of Haydn and Johann Christian Bach.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMusic history. 4aMusic theory.  a0208  a022120aPrinceton University.bMusic.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380718003652nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100003200159245006900191260005800260300001100318500007800329500004200407500002600449502004800475506006700523506005900590520224800649590002302897650002302920650001802943690000902961690000902970710004602979773005103025790000903076791001003085792000903095793001203104856015003116AAI1380905520191111131209.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060285  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13809055  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12895  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aGramespacher, Josef Andrew.10aDesign and Application of Conditionally Activated Split Inteins. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a174 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Muir, Tom W.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe discovery and characterization of inteins has led to the development of powerful applications capable of modulating protein structure and function through protein splicing. However, while inteins have found great utility  in-vitro with protein semi-synthesis applications, their use as tools to modify proteins in living systems has been limited by the-auto catalytic nature of the splicing reaction, which makes temporal control of their activity difficult. To address this issue, a variety of conditional protein splicing (CPS) methods have been developed to try and regulate the splicing reaction so that intein activity can be activated only upon addition of a specified trigger. However, these CPS methods have largely relied on inteins that suffer from a variety of unfavorable characteristics that constrain their broader utility, including slow splicing kinetics, poor stability, and stringent extein dependency. In contrast, the recently characterized fast splicing split inteins such as the DnaE intein Npu, are less susceptible to these limitations. Therefore, CPS methods based on naturally split fast splicing inteins should help to make in-cell intein based tools more broadly accessible. This thesis attempts to address this issue by utilizing a basic mechanistic understanding of how the split intein Npu assembles and splices to develop intein zymogens, the first CPS method that effectively controls the association and splicing of multiple fast splicing split inteins while remaining amenable to a diverse set of triggers. Utilizing our understanding of how the caged inteins function, we then developed a general method that can be easily and effectively applied to increase expression and functionality of split N-inteins and split protein-intein fusions, which are otherwise prone to aggregation. Lastly, we further engineer the intein zymogens so that close proximity of the caged intein fragments can be used to overcome splicing inhibition, paving the road for applications that have both temporal and spatial control over protein function. In combination, these methods should make it possible to develop previously impractical or intractable intein based applications and generally expand their utility in cells.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMolecular biology. 4aBiochemistry.  a0307  a048720aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380905503137nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002800159245007500187260005800262300001100320500007800331500004200409500003200451502004800483506005900531520180900590590002302399650001802422650001802440690000902458690000902467710004602476773005102522790000902573791001002582792000902592793001202601856015002613AAI1380915720191111131209.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060292  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13809157  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12896  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMcCready, Amelia Renee.10aQuorum-sensing Receptor-Ligand Interactions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a133 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Bassler, Bonnie L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aQuorum sensing is a cell-to-cell communication mechanism that bacteria use to orchestrate collective behaviors. Quorum sensing relies on the production, release, accumulation, and detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses multiple quorum-sensing systems, each composed of a receptor-autoinducer pair. Two of the P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing receptors, LasR and RhlR, are canonical LuxR-type receptors, meaning that they closely resemble the founding quorum-sensing receptor, as well as quorum-sensing receptors present in other species of Gram-negative bacteria. The cognate autoinducers for LuxR-type receptors are homoserine lactones. When bound to their ligands, LuxR-type receptors function as transcription factors that activate hundreds of genes underpinning collective behaviors. This work explores LasR and RhlR ligand binding preferences to understand how each of these receptors interacts with cognate and non-cognate ligands and how receptor-ligand interactions drive regulation of downstream quorum-sensing products. First, the work shows how LasR distinguishes between similar homoserine lactones as well as how LasR preferentially selects its own ligand from a mixture of related molecules. Second, the work reports RhlR ligand-independent mutants that display constitutive activity in vivo, providing insight into the enigmatic RhlR structure. Furthermore, the research demonstrates how the activities of RhlR ligand-independent mutants are kept in check with respect to regulation of quorum-sensing products. Finally, this thesis uses a RhlR ligand-independent mutant to reveal how RhlR works in conjunction with the PqsE thioesterase to regulate the production of the critical virulence factor pyocyanin.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aMicrobiology. 4aBiochemistry.  a0410  a048720aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380915703624nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001700159245008300176260005800259300001100317500007800328500004200406500003100448502004800479506005900527520228500586590002302871650001202894650002002906690000902926690000902935710006502944773005103009790000903060791001003069792000903079793001203088856015003100AAI1380940620191111131209.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060308  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13809406  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12897  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChen, Qiang.10aStimulated Raman Back-Scattering and Self-Guiding of Femtosecond Laser Pulses. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a161 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Suckewer, Szymon.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aPlasma has been proposed as the amplification medium for the next generation of ultra-high intensity lasers as it can sustain several orders of magnitude higher intensities than the thermal damage threshold of the solid-state optical elements, which is below 1012Wcm-2. Plasma-based Stimulated Raman Back-Scattering, SRBS, also known as Raman Amplification, seems to be a very efficient approach, although an energy transfer efficiency to the amplified seed did not reach 10% yet.Experiments and simulations on increasing efficiency and exploring better control of SRBS seed amplification were conducted at Princeton University. For example, particle-in-cell simulations help reveal the splitting of the amplified seed as a result of resonance slipping induced by the large pump chirp. In addition, a new scheme for SRBS was proposed, Stimulated Raman Near-Back-Scattering (SRNBS), while using a three-wave model, in which, by varying the pulse-front tilt angle of the pump, the length of the pump beam passing a plasma can be controlled. As a result, this new scheme may efficiently enhance the amplification, and at the same time, it could reduce the spontaneous Raman radiation that may pre-deplete the pump pulse. Simulations using the three-wave model was also applied to better understand the novel double-pass SRBS experiments. Landau damping and the frequency shift of Langmuir waves were identified as possible reasons for the low efficiency of single-pass amplifiers. In the double-pass scheme, those problems can be alleviated, due to plasma cooling between the two passes.Ionization assisted self-guiding of very tightly focused beams for more than 30 Rayleigh lengths was demonstrated with the transmission up to 80%. A cylindrical shock wave is necessary for the self-guiding and it is generated following the expansion of the plasma filament created by a laser line focus. As an intense femtosecond laser pulse propagates inside the shock wave, a small portion of the pulse's leading edge ionizes the neutrals near the inner wall of the cylindrical shock wave. Such created free electrons form a guiding structure for the trailing part of the pulse, which could enhance some laser-plasma interactions, including the recombination X-ray lasers developing in our lab.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aOptics. 4aPlasma physics.  a0752  a075920aPrinceton University.bMechanical and Aerospace Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380940603763nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001600159245008300175260005800258300001100316500007800327500004200405500004500447502004800492506006700540506005900607520231900666590002302985650002603008650002003034690000903054690000903063710006403072773005103136790000903187791001003196792000903206793001203215856015003227AAI1380997620191111131210.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060384  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13809976  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12899  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLi, Nannan.10aSimulations of Polymeric Nanoparticle Assembly Through Rapid Solvent Exchange. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a162 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aStructured nanoparticles are important for various scientific and industrial applications. For example, Janus particles can act as pigments in electronic paper, interfacial stabilizers, optical probes and catalysts; core-shell particles are useful in drug delivery; patchy particles can self-assemble into hierarchical structures. These applications require nanoparticles with a narrow size and morphology distribution, which needs to be addressed by the fabrication methods. In addition, a method which is simple and scalable is also desirable in order to achieve commercial applications of the nanoparticles. Flash Nanoprecipitation (FNP), which involves the rapid mixing of polymers in solution with a miscible non-solvent, is a continuous and scalable process that offers independent control over nanoparticle size, morphology, and composition.To understand the assembly mechanism of FNP and to make quantitative predictions for experiments, I performed molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. On the nanoscale, the MD simulations studied the assembly mechanism and revealed how nanoparticles with a range of surface structures, including Janus, core-shell and patchy, arise from different processing conditions. The simulations also indicated that nanoparticle morphologies and other properties such as the composition and patchiness can be reliably tuned. To reach macroscopic length- and time-scales, I performed KMC simulations and studied how nanoparticle size and size distribution can be controlled by processing parameters specific to FNP, such as the mixing rate and the feed concentration. The model produced results in quantitative agreement with experiments and also provided insights on particle aggregation mechanism through the solvent displacement process. This multi-scale simulation approach allows predictions for the FNP process from a given set of feed polymers and processing parameters. The results demonstrate that the process is highly promising for the production of structured nanoparticles with various surface features in a scalable and controlled way. These results also provide guidelines for future design and preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with desired properties using FNP techniques, and thus facilitate their applications in various areas.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aChemical engineering. 4aNanotechnology.  a0542  a065220aPrinceton University.bChemical and Biological Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380997603839nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002300159245004600182260005800228300001100286500007800297500004200375500003500417502004800452506006900500506006700569506005900636520238200695590002303077650002303100650002203123690000903145690000903154710003703163773005103200790000903251791001003260792000903270793001203279856015003291AAI1381006720191111131210.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060391  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810067  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12900  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChou, Winston Yan.10aEssays on Contemporary European Politics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a187 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Dancygier, Rafaela M.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation collects four essays on transformative developments in contemporary European politics. These include the polarization of European party systems, exemplified by the rise of outsider parties at the fringes of the political spectrum; the loosening of traditional partisan bonds; the erosion of the political center; and social polarization, driven by the politicization of Europeanization, immigration, and national identity.The first essay, Bad Times or Bad Types?, examines the rise of the populist right in Europe through the prism of local politics in France. Examining a natural experiment involving wrongheaded financial decisions by local governments, it shows that populist voting can be a mechanism of elite accountability—albeit one that is imperfect and conditioned by access to information.The second essay, The Distortionary Effects of Turnout Inequality,  examines the implications of the political dealignment of working-class voters for electoral outcomes and party strategy in contemporary German politics. It questions the longstanding belief that turnout inequality—the lower propensity for younger, less-educated, and lower-income respondents to vote—systematically disadvantages Left parties. Drawing on an original survey and experiment, it shows that nonvoters in Germany are indeed poorer and less-educated than the electorate, but that they are also significantly more xenophobic than supporters of Left parties.Taking a broader view, the third essay, Party Strategy After Social Democracy, counterposes two explanations for the decline of Left parties in Western Europe. These include (1) steadily diverging preferences between the Left's two traditional constituencies, middle- and working-class voters; and (2) the strategic decision of many Left parties to moderate in order to pursue more middle-class voters. It amasses historical and contemporary survey evidence to show that the decline of Left parties is structural rather than strategic in nature.The dissertation closes with a fourth essay, Lying on Surveys. This essay is unique in that it is mainly a contribution to political methodology, albeit with an application to survey data from Europe. In this chapter, I develop new statistical tools for measuring misreporting on surveys and apply them to a survey experiment conducted among radical right voters in Germany.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPolitical science. 4aEuropean studies.  a0440  a061520aPrinceton University.bPolitics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381006702833nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001700159245009700176260005800273300001100331500007800342500004200420500002800462502004800490506005900538520150400597590002302101650001902124650001602143690000902159690000902168710004102177773005102218790000902269791001002278792000902288793001202297856015002309AAI1381007220191111131210.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060407  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810072  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12901  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLow, Ryan J.10aTwo-Photon Imaging of Brain Regions in Fissures and Learning Manifolds from Neural Dynamics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a214 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Tank, David W.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aProgress in systems neuroscience requires effective tools and techniques for probing neural circuits, and for analyzing the resulting data in ways that drive theoretical insight. This thesis consists of three parts, aimed broadly toward furthering the measurement and analysis of neural circuits. In the first part, we present methods for two-photon imaging of brain regions situated in deep fissures, enabling the use of cellular resolution optical tools for probing areas such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). We demonstrate recordings of population activity in the mPFC and grid cells in the MEC in behaving mice. In the second part, we present an optical approach for measuring dopaminergic input to the mPFC with high spatiotemporal resolution, which has not been feasible using traditional methods. We demonstrate recordings of mPFC dopamine signals in behaving mice, and present preliminary evidence for fine-scale heterogeneity across individual dopaminergic axons. In the third part, we present a new unsupervised learning algorithm for inferring underlying, nonlinear structure in neuronal population activity. We use this algorithm to characterize the geometric properties of hippocampal activity and their relationship to behavior. And, we propose a conceptual model explaining how neural coding and trial-to-trial variability both arise from movement along a low dimensional, nonlinear activity manifold, driven by internal cognitive processes.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aNeurosciences. 4aPhysiology.  a0317  a071920aPrinceton University.bNeuroscience.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381007203873nam a2200397   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100002500159245011800184260005800302300001100360500007800371500004200449500003200491502004800523506005900571520243300630590002303063650001903086650002603105650003003131690000903161690000903170690000903179710004603188773005103234790000903285791001003294792000903304793001203313856015003325AAI1381030920191111131210.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060421  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810309  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12902  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPisano, Thomas John.10aConnectivity of the Posterior Cerebellum: Transsynaptic Viral Tracing with Light-Sheet Imaged Whole-Mouse Brains. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a194 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Wang, Samuel S.-H.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe cerebellum is conserved across vertebrate evolution, representing a constant mammalian brain fraction. Classically, the cerebellum has been associated only with motor functions. However, the nonmotor role of the cerebellum has recently begun to attract greater attention; currently, its role in brain processing is poorly understood. Cerebellar disruption has consequences beyond motor coordination. Injuries to the posterior cerebellum produces a cognitive-affective syndrome characterized by nonmotor impairment in executive function and affect.The cerebellum receives substantial input from nonmotor cortical regions and projects back to the neocortex. Much evidence has come from neuroanatomical viral tracing studies in primates, suggesting polysynaptic loops join forebrain areas with the cerebellum. Enriched understanding of nonmotor cerebellar function can be achieved by identifying cerebellar polysynaptic connections to nonmotor neocortical areas. Anatomical studies of nonmotor cerebello-cortical loops are instructive of the cerebellum's role in cognition and affect-function derived from structure.Transsynaptic tracing, histology, and subsequent analysis have challenges including low detection signal, tissue sectioning damage, and biases from manual quantification and anatomical assignment cells. Primary contributions of the thesis involve combining viral tracing with histological techniques for automated quantification of transsynaptic connectivity. I have optimized tissue clearing techniques for detection of virally-infected cells, allowing for volumetric imaging of whole-mouse brains with light-sheet microscopy. Using computational alignment software, I can automatedly and reproducibly register brain volumes to an atlas, removing error-prone manual structure identification. I have generated a local atlas with a complete cerebellum, which maintains translatability with the field standard that lacks the posterior cerebellum. This approach serves as a template solution anatomical commutability across research groups. Using neural networks, we have developed a three-dimensional cell detection pipeline capable of efficiently and accurately detecting polysynaptic connectivity in large brain volumes. Using this pipeline, I present findings showing the cerebellum densely projects to and can influence nonmotor brain regions with functions typically associated with autism spectrum disorder.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aNeurosciences. 4aCognitive psychology. 4aPhysiological psychology.  a0317  a0633  a098920aPrinceton University.bMolecular Biology.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381030903807nam a2200385   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001800159245012100177260005800298300001100356500007800367500004200445500003300487502004800520506006700568506005900635520237700694590002303071650001603094650001603110690000903126690000903135710003603144773005103180790000903231791001003240792000903250793001203259856015003271AAI1381032720191111131210.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060438  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810327  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12903  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLiu, Guannan.14aThe Mechanical Basis of Myxococcus xanthus Self-organization and Motility: From Single Cells to Collective Behavior. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a156 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Shaevitz, Joshua W.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMany living organisms exhibit complicated but highly organized collective behaviors. Unlike passive systems whose dynamics are driven by thermal energy, living organisms are often active systems, in which motilities of individuals put the system far away from equilibrium. Naturally living in soil, social bacteria Myxococcus xanthus exhibits a series of fascinating self-organizing behaviors throughout its developmental cycle, including swarming during vegetative growth, forming rippling waves during predation, and aggregating into fruiting bodies when starved. In this thesis, I use M. xanthus  as a model system and explore the mechanical basis behind its motility and self-organization. My work emphasizes on the utilization of microscopy, image processing techniques and data-driven analysis in the examination of  M. xanthus on different scales. We first study M. xanthus  fruiting body formation based on the statistical physics of active populations. We show that the aggregation process in M. xanthus resembles the dynamics of a spinodal decomposition phase separation. Modeling  M. xanthus as active brownian particles, we demonstrate that the phase separation can be understood in terms of cell density and the Peclet number that captures the cell motility regarding its speed and reversal frequency.  M. xanthus cells actively take advantage of their cellular control of motility to drive large scale aggregation by promoting gliding speed and suppressing reversals to increase motility persistence. Then we characterize the rippling behavior of M. xanthus both on single cell motility level and on population level. We find tracking data of single cells during rippling lacks the evidence to support the cell motion synchronization hypothesis. Using two different image processing techniques, we are able to characterize low density rippling structures by estimating local cell density. We further examine the high density rippling wave structures using a 3D laser microscope. Finally, we study the force generation mechanism of two distinct motility systems in M. xanthus. We find that cells use these motility systems in coordination while in groups. These results not only provided further understandings of the scale of forces M. xanthus experiences and exerts, but also suggests that M. xanthus mainly utilizes gliding motility during group migration.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aPhysiology. 4aBiophysics.  a0719  a078620aPrinceton University.bPhysics.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381032703789nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001800159245011600177260005800293300001100351500007800362500004200440500004500482502004800527506005900575520238300634590002303017650002503040650002703065690000903092690000903101710006403110773005103174790000903225791001003234792000903244793001203253856015003265AAI1381045520191111131211.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060445  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810455  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12904  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHe, Xiaogang.10aDroughts and Floods in a Changing Environment Natural Influences, Human Interventions, and Policy Implications. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a229 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Sheffield, Justin;Wood, Eric F.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHydrological extremes, in the form of droughts and floods, have huge impacts on a wide range of sectors including, most prominently, water availability, food security, and energy production, among others. The expectation of heightened drought and flood risk under climate change, coupled with burgeoning population growth and rapid economic development, poses unprecedented challenges for societies to boost resilience to these natural hazards, mitigate their extreme impact, and develop effective and actionable solutions towards sustainable development. The objective of this dissertation is to advance our understanding of these hydroclimate risks and their societal impact in a changing environment through a coupled human and natural system (CHANS).Chapter 2 and 3 diagnose the changing characteristics of droughts and floods from a climate perspective. Chapter 2 compiles the first Global Drought and Flood Catalogue (GDFC) to provide long-term, consistent and robust estimates of drought and flood hazards. This state-of-the-art catalogue acts as a basis for us to understand current risks and how they may change in the future. Based on GDFC, Chapter 3 develops a novel statistical framework to examine the often overlooked but important risk of coincident droughts and floods.Chapter 4 and 5 focus on the human dimension of the CHANS. Using a physical framework, Chapter 4 conducts attribution analysis to disentangle how climate variability and human interventions (e.g., water use, irrigation, reservoir operation) intensify or mitigate the recent California drought. Taking a further step, Chapter 5 aims to incorporate human behaviors and decisions—which are currently unrepresented—into a large-scale hydrological model to investigate how individuals' decisions and their behavioral heterogeneity affect the dynamics of the CHANS. Chapter 6 develops a hydro-economic model to identify possible solutions and optimal development pathways towards better management of water-related trade-offs (i.e., energy production and irrigation in California) and environmental sustainability (i.e., groundwater depletion).The integrated modeling platform developed in this thesis can be used to balance trade-offs among conflicting objectives and quantify the potential space for improving current water management strategies, especially under severe hydrological extremes.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aHydrologic sciences. 4aEnvironmental studies.  a0388  a047720aPrinceton University.bCivil and Environmental Engineering.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381045503691nam a2200373   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001800159245011800177260005800295300001100353500007800364500004200442500003200484502004800516506005900564520232500623590002302948650002102971650001902992690000903011690000903020710004703029773005103076790000903127791001003136792000903146793001203155856015003167AAI1381097420191111131211.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060452  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810974  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12905  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aGuo, Jinsong.10aKnowing Number: Mathematics, Astronomy, and the Changing Culture of Learning in Middle-Period China, 1100–1300. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a278 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Elman, Benjamin A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation seeks to integrate the history of mathematical knowledge in middle-period China with the history of its learned culture. It challenges the traditional historiographic image of Chinese mathematics and astronomy as socially and epistemically isolated enterprises, and argues that their significant development in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was in deep connection with the primary programs of learning for the literati and for those who aspired to become one of them—reading texts and comprehending tradition. In so doing, the study stresses the overlapping ventures of knowledge making under the broad rubric of “number” (shu 數) and the communication between divergent intellectual groups in a time when the hierarchy of “learning” (xue 學) was flexible and contestable.This dissertation is divided into two parts, each in turn consisting of two chapters in the form of case studies. Part I mainly focuses on mathematics in the Southern Song (1127–1279), highlighting the connected endeavors of mathematicians and literati in the making and application of numerical knowledge largely outside of state sponsorship or control. Part II turns to Chinese mathematical astronomy under the Mongol Empire (1206–1259) and the early Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), featuring a stronger presence of political power as well as cross-cultural elements.In the first part, chapter 1 analyzes and compares three Southern Song publishers of mathematical books, who belonged to divergent social groups of literati and practitioners but displayed parallel efforts to make mathematical knowledge more accessible through printed texts. Chapter 2 discusses literati scholars' and mathematicians' shared engagement with numerical problems related to milfoil divination and the Classic of Changes (Yijing 易經).In the second part, chapter 3 looks into the uses of textual investigations in the calendar reform of the Yuan around 1280, highlighting the astronomers' precise choice of hermeneutical stance and its relation with contemporary classical scholarship. Chapter 4 examines the Chinese study of meridian differences in the Eurasian context and shows how contacts with Islamic knowledge brought about a new spatial as well as cultural awareness in the Chinese conception of astronomical knowledge.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aScience history. 4aAsian history.  a0332  a058520aPrinceton University.bEast Asian Studies.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381097403392nam a2200409   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040001900140100001400159245006000173260005800233300001100291500007800302500004200380500003000422502004800452506006700500506005900567520195900626590002302585650001902608650001602627650003002643690000902673690000902682690000902691710004102700773005102741790000902792791001002801792000902811793001202820856015002832AAI1381162620191111131211.5191111s2019    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060469  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13811626  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12906  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLy, Ryan.14aThe Role of the Pulvinar in Selective Visual Attention. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a107 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Kastner, Sabine.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aOur visual system has a limited capacity to process the complex, cluttered environment around us. Information relevant to guiding our current behavior needs to be selectively enhanced. This process is known as selective visual attention. Lesion studies and electrophysiological recordings reveal a network of brain areas, including the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, that is important for visual attention. However, the role of the pulvinar in visual attention and how it interacts with other areas is poorly understood. To approach this problem, we first developed novel methods to to record neuronal activity from multiple subdivisions of the pulvinar in macaque monkeys using multi-electrode arrays while they performed a spatial attention task. During the period of the task when attention was maintained, spiking activity of putative inhibitory neurons in the pulvinar was suppressed, suggesting that attention operates through selective disinhibition of pulvinar relay cells. In addition, spikes from dorsal pulvinar neurons synchronized with the local field potential in the ventral pulvinar during attention, which suggests that the dorsal pulvinar and connected attentional control areas may bias early visual areas by modulating ventral pulvinar activity. Secondly, we identified low-dimensional structure in pulvinar population spiking activity that suggests oscillatory-like dynamics in spiking during sustained attention. Finally, we recorded neuronal activity simultaneously from the lateral pulvinar and two interconnected cortical areas and examined network interactions during attention. We found evidence suggesting that the pulvinar synchronizes oscillatory activity between cortical areas during attention and may also support sustained, elevated spiking activity in these areas. Together, these results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the thalamic and thalamo-cortical networks underlying selective visual attention.  aSchool code: 0181. 4aNeurosciences. 4aPhysiology. 4aPhysiological psychology.  a0317  a0719  a098920aPrinceton University.bNeuroscience.0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  a0181  aPh.D.  a2019  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:13811626
