These competitive malfunctions led to public utility-style regulation for these industries in which regulators determined market entry, exit, prices, and service options for regulated firms. Beginning in the 1970s, the economic deregulation movement vowed to reintroduce market competition to industries dominated by regulated monopolies and cartels. Now four decades later, many deregulated industries have?contrary to expectations?grown more concentrated and less competitive. Comparing the deregulation of freight railroading and wireline telecommunications in the United States, this dissertation offers a historically grounded explanation for the emergence of deregulated market power.I highlight a common dilemma in such infrastructure industries. To compete, network service providers must have network access to end customers. To the extent network access is concentrated in the hands of a few incumbents, potential rivals with limited network assets of their own operate at a distinct disadvantage in entering new markets.Recognizing these challenges, policymakers have adopted different solutions to problems of concentrated network access. In freight railroading, policymakers encouraged intermodal competition between rival transportation modes (railroad versus truck, barge, or pipeline). In wireline telecommunications, policymakers by contrast encouraged the sharing of incumbent networks with competitors. The origins of these different network access regimes were rooted in how each industry was deregulated differently in response to different industry problems. As such, deregulation followed an industry-specific logic. In freight railroading, the bailout of bankrupt carriers permitted greater network consolidation. In wireline telecommunications, efforts to undo the historically unprecedented telephone monopoly of AT&T led to greater network fragmentation.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Sociology0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342485640uNO_ARK_FOUND03613nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100003500164245012000199260005800319300001100377500007800388500004200466500002800508502004800536506006900584506006700653506005900720520224000779710005003019773005103069793001203120856015003132856001703282AAI1342557220191111131201.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059869  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13425572  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12854  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aEscobar, Jose Antonio Araguez.10aRethinking the Formal Domain: Deep Scientization of Design and Architecture-Engineering Hybrid, 1956-2006 Volume I. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a633 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Lavin, Sylvia.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation identifies the emergence of a sublineage in the tradition of the architecture-engineering hybrid between the mid-1950s and the mid-2000s through an examination of the work of Vittorio Giorgini (1926?2010), Michael Burt (b. 1937), and Cecil Balmond (b. 1943). These three figures operated at the margins of the architecture discipline, but none was an architect-engineer in any customary sense. Rather, it is the ensemble of their production that, embodying a three-dimensionality characteristic of the nature, purview, and scale of architecture?if strongly driven by science and by aspects traditionally associated with structural engineering?I interpret as constituting the said sublineage.The discussion of Giorgini?s, Burt?s, and Balmond?s bodies of work is here framed in relation to both the general and the particular conditions of possibility enabling their appearance: the general conditions being an overarching paradigm triggered by an acute scientization of design that unfolded across the West over the course of the second half of the twentieth century; the particular conditions?wired into the general?being the specific academic, professional, and discursive contexts in which each design thinking originated and evolved. I illustrate the degree to which each body of work, while determined by these two levels of contextual influence, was idiosyncratic with respect to both, and show the importance of their differentiating traits. For I argue and attempt to demonstrate that the architectural thinking embedded in the idiosyncratic character of the oeuvre of Giorgini, Burt, and Balmond gives rise to a realm of design that is a distinctly appropriate medium through which to craft a new conceptualization of form in architecture.In pursuing this argument and attendant conceptualization, I seek to rethink the bounds of the formal domain in architectural thinking. In contrast to formal epistemologies revolving around external envelope, volumetric outline, or ?mass,? this study is grounded in the notion of spatial organization and related terms such as configuration, arrangement, and disposition. The former sphere of signification is made to correspond to ?shape? and the latter to form proper.2 aPrinceton University.bSchool of Architecture0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342557240uNO_ARK_FOUND03849nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100003700164245013100201260005800332300001100390500007800401500004200479500003000521502004800551506006900599506006700668506005900735520242800794710004403222773005103266793001203317856015003329856005603479AAI1342674020191111131201.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059890  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13426740  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12858  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aVedoveli Francisco, Paula Elena.10aPrivate Capital, Public Credit: Brazil, Argentina, and the Problem of Credibility in International Capital Markets, 1852?1914. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a743 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Adelman, Jeremy.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aPrivate Capital, Public Credit examines how Brazilian and Argentine governments promoted their public credit at international capital markets from the 1850s to World War I. It focuses on the relationships that connected sovereign governments to contractors and issuers of foreign debt in London and Paris, and particularly on credibility brokers, a group of actors responsible for establishing and maintaining these connections. Credibility brokers were able to manage the flow of information between decision-makers in borrowing countries and bankers in international capital markets and promoted trusting relationships with actors on both sides of the Atlantic through repeated interactions and the development of affective bonds. Credibility brokers, therefore, shaped financial intermediaries' capacity to assess sovereign risk and influenced debtors' ability to make and sustain credible commitments. Their performance was dependent on the actors' private capital, including the character of the ties that connected them to statesmen in Latin America and bankers in Europe, their ability to adopt the elements that constituted the culture of personal credibility, their capacity to operate independently in capital markets and control the nature of the information available to European investors, and the political capital they enjoyed amongst decision-making elites in borrowing countries.This cosmopolitan model of credibility brokerage started to wane in the last decade of the nineteenth century when financial crises in Brazil and Argentina and the failure of one of the most reputable banking houses in London undermined investors? trust on the capacity of financial intermediaries to correctly assess risk and monitor sovereign borrowers. The transition to a model of sovereign credibility based on economic indicators and credit-ratings occurred gradually in the first half of the twentieth century. The adoption of this model signaled a growing distrust towards the capacity of personal judgment and knowledge to regulate sovereign bond markets, while the expansion of the investing public and the erosion of actors? capacity to control the flow of information enabled the change. Credibility brokers, however, have remained a feature of sovereign bond markets, called to perform their roles when the power of numbers has proved insufficient to broker credible commitments in times of heightened uncertainty.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of History0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342674040uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01ks65hg00n02378nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002700164245007000191260005800261300001100319500007800330500004200408500003400450502004800484506006900532506006700601506005900668520102200727710004601749773005101795793001201846856015001858856005602008AAI1342694220191111131201.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059906  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13426942  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12859  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aPangborn, Nicole Anne.10aEthnicity, Emotions, and Relations in an Italian-American Suburb. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a155 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Duneier, Mitchell D.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation examines the persistence of Italian-American ethnicity in the suburbs of Providence, Rhode Island.

I show how, over the course of social interaction, the legacies of Italian-American ethnicity in this particular place work to shape individuals' feelings of self-worth, to structure their relations with others, to limit occupational and residential mobility, and to inform interpretations of current events. These findings a.) run contrary to the expectations of scholars who view ethnicity for late-generation European groups as no more than "symbolic" (Gans, 1979), b.) contribute to a better understanding of the current historical moment in the United States, and c.) complicate sociological perspectives on assimilation and ethnic group relations more generally.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Sociology0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342694240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01g158bm09303636nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002600164245009600190260005800286300001100344500007800355500004200433500002800475502004800503506006900551506006700620506005900687520225300746710005402999773005103053793001203104856015003116856005603266AAI1342741320191111131201.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059913  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427413  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12860  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aKoos, Joseph Douglas.10aInvestigation of the Maturation and Degradation of Lasso Peptides through In Vitro Studies. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a148 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Link, Aaron J.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aLasso peptides are a class of small molecules characterized by a unique threaded structure. In addition to this shape, lasso peptides are also of interest due to their range of properties, ranging from narrow spectrum anti-microbial to inhibiting viral envelope fusion. In recent years, with the increase in genomes available, it has become apparent that lasso peptides are present in a wider range of bacteria than had been identified through traditional natural products screening. In Chapters 2, a gene cluster containing two lasso peptides from the freshwater bacterium Asticcacaulis excentricus was examined to learn more about the promiscuity of lasso peptide related enzymes. The gene cluster contained a novel enzyme, termed a lasso isopeptidase, which can turn lasso peptides into a linear form. Using alanine scanning of the precursor peptides, it was determined that both the maturation enzymes as well as the isopeptidase were able to process a range of substrates. In Chapter 3, the structure of the isopeptidase enzyme was solved with and without precursor to learn more about how it recognized its substrates. In addition, the isopeptidase sequence was used to identify novel lasso peptide gene clusters, further expanding the known examples for this class. In Chapter 4, a novel lasso peptide gene cluster from Thermobifida fusca, a thermophilic bacterium, was identified as a source of soluble maturation enzymes for lasso peptide biosynthesis. The product was produced both through heterologous expression in E. coli, as well as by incubation of the precursor peptide with the maturation enzymes in vitro. This system was used to determine for the first time information about lasso peptide biosynthetic rates. In Chapter 5, a lasso peptide gene cluster was identified from Thermobifida cellulosilytica with a previously unidentified O-methyltransferase within the cluster. In addition, a similar enzyme was also identified within an unexplored class of products called actinopeptides. Each of these systems was explored through a combination of heterologous expression and in vitro experiments. Through the course of these studies, lasso peptide biosynthesis and degradation are on a more solid foundation for future examination.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Molecular Biology0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342741340uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01bc386n01303792nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002100164245007200185260005800257300001100315500007800326500004200404500003000446502004800476506006900524506006700593506005900660520244600719710004403165773005103209793001203260856015003272856005603422AAI1342762620191111131202.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059920  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427626  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12861  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aMack, Jessica R.10aA Campus for Mexico: Knowledge and Power in UNAM's University City. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a278 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Adelman, Jeremy.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aIn June of 1950, the first stone was ceremoniously placed on a construction site several kilometers south of Mexico City?s center. Building had officially begun on a long-imagined campus for the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM): the utopian Ciudad Universitaria, or University City. By tracing its spatial reconfiguration on a new modernist campus, this dissertation explains the national university?s shifting role in Mexico?s developing revolutionary state and examines the ways in which new national priorities were inscribed upon intellectual and cultural life. The largest university in Latin America, with over 330,000 students today and a sprawling 2,500-acre urban campus, UNAM has trained Mexico?s most powerful decision makers, set the terms of public debates and posed questions that have shaped decades of policy. It is also an important channel through which citizens have participated?with both consent and contestation?in Mexico?s twentieth-century public life. Although it is an icon of modern Mexico, we know surprisingly little about UNAM?s historical role in shaping the social landscape and the reproduction of power. From the earliest imaginings of a utopian lettered city immediately after the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), this project traces the long twentieth-century arc of Ciudad Universitaria?s creation alongside the national university?s turbulent relationship with the revolutionary state. As the prominent modernist architects of Ciudad Universitaria solidified the ruling party?s interpretation of the revolution in stone, social justice and agrarian reform were replaced by a new set of priorities. In conversation with a growing body of scholarship on Mexico?s midcentury, the dissertation explores how this monumental state building project spatially manifested the ruling party?s vision for Mexico?s future and was made possible by its new priorities of urbanization, industrialization and developmentalism. From imagining and planning the campus in the late 1940s to its rapid construction from 1950-1954, the dissertation uses the archives of planners, architects, local residents and bureaucrats to reveal new modes of operating. Once students and faculty arrived, the project traces intellectual and social reconfiguration at Ciudad Universitaria, changes that would reshape Mexico City?s urban landscape and realign contestation in national politics into the late twentieth century.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of History0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342762640uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp016m311s10h03740nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001400164245005600178260005800234300001100292500007800303500004200381500003700423502004800460506005900508520255500567710005903122773005103181793001203232856015003244856005603394AAI1342775720191111131202.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059937  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427757  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12862  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aDong, Ge.10aNonlinear Dynamics of the Kinetic Ballooning Modes. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a124 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Bhattacharjee, Amitava.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aKinetic ballooning modes (KBM) are widely believed to play a critical role in explosive and disruptive dynamics in laboratory and space plasmas. While the nonlinear evolution of ballooning modes has been proposed as a mechanism for the eruptive events in the tokamak edge, known as edge localized modes (ELMs), and magnetospheric substorms, the role of kinetic effects in such nonlinear dynamics with potentially impulsive behavior remains largely unexplored. Detailed studies of the KBM nonlinear dynamics can help in understanding the cause and properties of the eruptive behavior and large turbulent transport in ELMs, and potentially contribute in our ability to predict and even control them in experiments. In this thesis nonlinear dynamics and saturation mechanism of KBM are presented using primarily global gyrokinetic particle-in-cell simulation results. The compressional component of magnetic perturbation ?B? can be important for KBM in high ? plasmas. A numerical scheme that includes ? B? in first-principles gyrokinetic simulations has been formulated, implemented and benchmarked as a first step. With the perturbed electrostatic potential, and both the perpendicular and the parallel magnetic perturbations, KBM nonlinear evolution is studied for the Cyclone Base Case (CBC) parameters. In contrast to the finite-time singularity predicted by ideal MHD theory, the kinetic instability is shown to develop into an intermediate nonlinear regime of exponential growth, followed by a nonlinear saturation regulated by spontaneously generated zonal fields. The zonal fields, including both the zonal flow (flux-surface averaged electrostatic potential) and the zonal current (flux-surface averaged parallel vector potential), are shown to be important in governing the nonlinear mode structure, and in suppressing trans- port. The kinetic intermediate nonlinear regime resembles the intermediate regime already discovered in the full MHD simulations. During this regime, rapid growth of localized current sheet, which can induce tearing mode and magnetic reconnection, is observed. In the KBM simulations using experimentally measured equilibrium at the DIII-D tokamak edge, the nonlinear convective motion appears to compete with the shearing effect produced by zonal fields, which is weaker in the narrow pedestal steep gradient region compared with that in the core plasma. The effects of the zonal fields and the nonlinear non-zonal convection together regulate the KBM nonlinear saturation level in the DIII-D steep gradient region.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Astrophysical Sciences0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342775740uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp012v23vx19103191nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002600164245005400190260005800244300001100302500007800313500004200391500004500433502004800478506005900526520197500585710007202560773005102632793001202683856015002695856005602845AAI1342783120191111131203.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059944  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427831  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12863  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aSantos, Andrew Pablo.10aSurfactant and Colloid Self-assembly Simulations. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a135 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aSurfactants and colloids are ubiquitous in biology, the environment, home and personal care products, and industrial applications. The self-assembly of surfactants into micellar aggregates is crucial to their use in many industrial applications, including: detergency, cosmetics, oil-spill remediation and nanoparticle dispersion. Because of their ubiquity, surfactant and colloid self-assembly are canonical subjects of soft matter study, yet there are concentration effects, for example the free surfactant concentration, that remain difficult to measure and understand. We present our findings on the driving forces behind aspects of self-assembly and methodologies for characterizing the behavior of three self-assembling systems: colloids with short-range attraction long-range repulsion, nonionic surfactants and ionic surfactants. To study molecular details of these systems, we use Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with implicit-solvent models. We directly compare different methods for calculating the critical micelle concentration in all self-assembling systems. We establish that excluded volume and counterion condensation are the main driving forces for the decrease of free surfactant concentration in nonionic and ionic surfactants, respectively. We compare counterion condensation and mean ionic activity measurements directly to experiments, and address experimental disagreements. For short-range attraction long-range repulsion colloids, conditions are found where large preferred aggregates have no net effect on the pressure, which is strikingly different behavior from surfactant self-assembly. The results in this thesis offer a deeper understanding of the phenomena of low-concentration self-assembly, leading to improved methods for estimating micellar properties over wider concentration ranges. These methods will benefit the development of more accurate molecular models and speed up development of new industrial formulations.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342783140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01z316q439j03339nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001900164245008600183260005800269300001100327500007800338500004200416500004000458502004800498506005900546520217000605710004402775773005102819793001202870856015002882856001703032AAI1342786720191111131203.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059951  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427867  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12864  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aAdair, Carl C.10aFaithful Readings: Religion, Hermeneutics, and the Habits of Criticism 1880?1950. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a203 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Fuss, Diana;Kotin, Joshua.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aFaithful Readings outlines a revisionist history of the discourse and practice of Anglo-American literary criticism between 1880 and 1950. This dissertation contests the secularization narratives that structure many received histories of the discipline, narratives in which habits of critical interpretation and reflection inevitably supersede or simply survive a credulous, pre-modern religion that had become increasingly untenable through the nineteenth century. The project presents a genealogy of this enduring concept of religion as naive and literal belief, arguing that the concept was produced as a polemical strategy in a theological contest: it was first promoted not by disinterested secular critics but by the under-remarked nineteenth-century theological movement known as Protestant modernism as a dismissive depiction of its theological rivals. For modernists, faith was a self-consciously interpretive relation to the Christian tradition as a complex of historically and culturally mediated forms whose ultimate object was an ineffable, infinite reality: defined against propositional belief, true religion was a way of reading this tradition critically. This dissertation argues that the habits of literary criticism developed in this period were recursively entangled with the powerful and problematic hermeneutics that defined this one contemporary Protestant theology. In chapters dedicated to the reading practices of such formative figures as Matthew Arnold, John Crowe Ransom, Cleanth Brooks, and T.S. Eliot, the project elucidates the political, epistemological, and institutional pressures that led both biblical and literary critics to develop new methods to legitimize their work as specialized, modern disciplines and also to remain faithful to their cherished texts as authorities that exceeded the knowledge such specialized methods could produce. Thinking beyond the purported opposition between the critical and the religious, the project defamiliarizes tensions within enduring habits of literary criticism and invites serious reflection on the forms of discipline that may be required should critics decide to change their habits.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of English0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342786740uNO_ARK_FOUND04232nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001700164245009900181260005800280300001100338500007800349500004200427500003200469502004800501506005900549520305000608710005403658773005103712793001203763856015003775856001703925AAI1342790320191111131203.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059968  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427903  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12865  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aHan, Siyang.10aBiomechanical Regulation of Cell Proliferation, Epithelialmesenchymal Transition and Invasion. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a127 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Nelson, Celeste M.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aCells in epithelial tissues adhere to an underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) and respond to changes in its physical properties by altering gene expression and behavior. The mechanical properties of the ECM, including the matrix stiffness, are therefore central to developmental, physiological, and pathological processes. In the context of cancer, increased tissue stiffness and interstitial fluid pressure are inherent features of tumorigenesis, which promote malignant transformation of surrounding cells and correlate with poor survival. These processes depend on the synergistic effects of mechanical signals such as ECM stiffness and chemical signals such as Wnt, TGF? and proteases in the cellular microenvironment. This dissertation explores how mechanical and biochemical signals are integrated to control cell behaviors including proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasion. We used engineered substrata to recapitulate the mechanical stiffnesses of the normal mammary gland as well as that of breast tumors.We found that exposure to Wnt3a increased proliferation of mammary epithelial cells cultured on stiff substrata, with compliances characteristic of breast tumors, but not of cells on soft substrata, with compliances comparable to that of normal mammary tissue. Depleting integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which functions as a signaling hub for cellular mechanotransduction, rendered cells unresponsive to Wnt3a on both substrata. Ectopic expression of ILK permitted Wnt3a to induce proliferation of cells on both microenvironments. We further showed that ILK regulates expression of the Wnt receptor frizzled-1 (Fzd1), suggesting the existence of a positive feedback loop between Wnt3a, ILK and Fzd1.Following these findings, we examined the role of ILK and tissue stiffness in regulating cell fate in response to TGF?1. We found that ILK controls the switch between apoptosis and EMT downstream of TGF?1 through modulating the fine balance between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. Specifically, depletion of ILK leads to increased E-cadherin-based cell-cell adhesion and cortical actin and decreased focal adhesions and stress fibers in mammary epithelial cells. These changes favor apoptosis and suppress EMT downstream of TGF?1, regardless of matrix stiffness. Similarly, soft matrix also favors apoptosis downstream of TGF?1 while stiff matrix promotes EMT, suggesting that depletion of ILK disrupts the ability of a cell to sense a mechanically stiff microenvironment.Taken together, these findings suggest that tissue mechanics regulates the cellular response to Wnt and TGF? under physiological and pathological microenvironmental conditions. We also highlighted the role of ILK in mediating the responses to matrix stiffness and tuning the proliferative and potential tumorigenic behaviors of mammary epithelial cells to Wnt3a and TGF?1. These results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of a pathological microenvironment on neoplastic progression.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Molecular Biology0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342790340uNO_ARK_FOUND03207nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001900164245006500183260005800248300001100306500007800317500004200395500002600437502004800463506006700511506005900578520194500637710005402582773005102636793001202687856015002699856005602849AAI1342795220191111131204.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059975  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427952  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12866  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aJani, Krupa S.10aMechanistic Studies of Epigenetic Regulation by the H3 Tail. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a179 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Muir, Tom W.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe N-terminal tail of histone H3 is heavily post-translationally modified. Numerous regulatory lysine residues are methylated, and these modifications play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression. Trimethylation at H3K27 (H3K27me3) is associated with transcriptional silencing of genes important in growth and development. Intriguingly, H3K27me3 is mutually exclusive with H3K36 tri-methylation on the same histone tail. Disruptions in this crosstalk result in aberrant H3K27/H3K36 methylation patterns and altered transcriptional profiles that have been implicated in tumorigenesis and other disease states. Despite their importance, the molecular details of this crosstalk are unclear. This thesis presents work revealing an unusual mode of allosteric enzyme modulation by its histone H3 substrate molecule. PRC2-mediated H3K27 methylation is sensitive to the chromatin environment, including the methylation state of H3K36 on the same histone tail.    We demonstrate that PRC2 is allosterically activated in cis by the unmodified side chain of H3K36, and that this activation results in a 5-fold increase in the kcat of its enzymatic activity catalyzing H3K27 methylation compared to activity on a substrate methylated at H3K36. Utilizing a photocrosslinking-MS strategy and histone methyltransferase activity assays with PRC2 mutants, we find that the catalytic subunit EZH2 contains a specific sensing pocket for H3K36 methylation state which allows the PRC2 complex to distinguish between modified and unmodified H3K36 residues, altering enzymatic activity accordingly to preferentially methylate the unmodified nucleosome substrate. Avenues for inhibition of PRC2 by targeting its interactions with the H3 tail are also explored. Beyond its interactions with polycomb machinery, H3K36 and other sections of the H3 tail may also have roles of epigenetic regulation of other cellular processes such as DNA damage response.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Molecular Biology0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342795240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01js956j61804141nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001400164245005800178260005800236300001100294500007800305500004200383500003300425502004800458506006900506506005900575520289000634710004603524773005103570793001203621856015003633856005603783AAI1342796220191111131204.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059982  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13427962  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12867  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aChen, Li.10aQuantitative Analysis of Folate and NADPH Metabolism. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a146 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Rabinowitz, Joshua.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aFolic acid and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) play important roles in supporting cell growth. Folic acid, known as vitamin B9, is critical for nucleotide and amino acid synthesis by mediating the transfer and transformation of a one-carbon unit. NADPH, derived from niacin or vitamin B3, is the high-energy electron carrier that is used for antioxidant defense, as well as the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides, fatty acid and sterols. It is thought that synergy of the two pathways for cell growth may include direct metabolic interactions, and cancer cells may hijack these pathways for uncontrolled proliferation. However, a comprehensive understanding of folate and NADPH metabolism are hindered by the instability and low abundance of related species.Here, on the folate side, we developed an analytical method to measure intracellular folate species from mammalian cells, using an isotope-labeling strategy combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). This new method has enabled a CRISPR knockout folate metabolism study that showed a reversal of the cytosolic folate pathway is capable of compensating mitochondrial folate deficiency. On the NADPH side, we quantitatively demonstrated that the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP) is the main source of NADPH?s high energy electrons across cancer cell lines, through a deuterium ( 2H) isotope tracing analysis and a CRISPR knockout study. In the 2H tracing analysis, we found the redox-active hydrogen on NADPH can exchange with ambient water through a Flavin-enzyme catalyzed mechanism. Analysis of major NADPH production pathway knockout cells also suggested any of the oxPPP, malic enzyme 1 (ME1) or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) is enough to support cell growth, but oxPPP is uniquely required to maintain a normal NADPH/NADP ratio in cancer cell lines. Previous literature showed that the folate pathway could be an important NADPH production pathway, especially in combating oxidative stress for human melanoma cells during metastasis. We discovered a second NADPH-folate connection that high NADP inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), resulting in impaired folate-mediated biosynthesis across different cancer cell lines. To explore the terrain of metabolism, we developed a computational network analysis approach for new metabolites discovery by connecting mass from untargeted metabolomics data and known metabolite database. The concept has been validated by analyzing an annotated yeast metabolomics dataset, and preliminary results identified a cluster of potential metabolites specifically accumulated in kidney that may relate to thiamine (vitamin B1) metabolism.In summary, this study provides novel methods and insights to study folate and NADPH metabolism, shedding light on the intricacy of metabolism for cell growth and potential cancer therapeutics.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Chemistry0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342796240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01f4752k54803741nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002400164245008900188260005800277300001100335500007800346500004200424500004500466502004800511506005900559520249200618710007203110773005103182793001203233856015003245856005603395AAI1342804620191111131204.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392059999  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428046  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12868  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aReinhart, Wesley F.10aStrategies for Predicting, Understanding, and Controlling Colloidal Crystallization. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a204 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aColloidal crystals continue to draw attention for their applications in photonics, energy conversion, and biosensing, as well as for their usefulness in elucidating questions in fundamental physics and materials science. However, the wide range of applications for these particles is made possible by the equally wide range of possible self-assembled structures, which may be amorphous or crystalline, close-packed or open, and may include defects with varying morphology and concentration. Experiments, simulations, and theoretical treatments have all shown that this rich phase behavior is enabled by relatively weak interactions between the particles, which leads to small differences in free energy between competing equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures, presenting unique challenges in the fabrication and analysis of the resulting materials. This dissertation explores two complementary topics which both support the goal of engineering advanced materials through directed assembly of colloidal crystals.In the first half of this work, I explore the crystallization of triblock Janus colloids through a variety of simulation methods. I begin by calculating the equilibrium thermodynamic phase diagrams for these particles under a wide variety of conditions, quantifying the driving forces which stabilize each of the competing crystal polymorphs. I next evaluate the crystallization kinetics of several of these solid phases, finding that the different assembly mechanisms of each crystal lattice lead to surprising behaviors. Finally, I demonstrate how a patterned substrate biases the morphology of a crystal film toward large single crystals of a particularly useful polymorph.In the second half, I develop a novel framework for crystal characterization which infers relationships between observed structures automatically rather than relying on pre-programmed templates. I begin by establishing the mathematical basis for this method, showing how my Neighborhood Graph Analysis (NGA) can be used to identify crystal lattices from particle tracking data. Next I extend the framework to binary systems, demonstrating the first-ever automatic characterization of binary superlattices. Finally, I describe a streamlined version of the algorithm which reduces the computational cost by several orders of magnitude, allowing it to be implemented into a fully automated characterization and visualization workflow which is used to investigate a wide variety of crystal lattices.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342804640uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp019c67wq63v03842nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001900164245010300183260005800286300001100344500007800355500004200433500004800475502004800523506006900571506005900640520251500699710005703214773005103271793001203322856015003334856005603484AAI1342805220191111131205.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060001  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428052  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12869  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aAyers, Elaine.10aStrange Beauty: Botanical Collecting, Preservation, and Display in the Nineteenth Century Tropics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a547 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Burnett, D.

The plants written into scientific and aesthetic descriptions of ?tropical nature,? I argue, constructed a view of rainforests as extractable, collectible storehouses caught somewhere between fecundity and loss, between beauty and decay. I focus on four plants transformed from curious objects in the field to herbarium specimens in Britain and Europe bound up in debates over evolution and "normalcy" while speaking to the developing ideals and disillusionments of tropical nature. These objects confused reproductive boundaries, embodying the possibilities and perceived environmental dangers while challenging typical labor practices producing a collectible, useful, and containable nature.Chapter One follows the most miniscule, mundane, of plants: Moss. Paradoxically figured as both "pure" in its seemingly invisible self-reproduction and salacious in its place in pornography, moss functioned as a preservative agent for more "valuable" plants. Simultaneously, botanists interested in moss on its own terms transformed this packing material into an object of microscopic inquiry. Next, I follow an orchid illustrated by a prolific female artist. Explicitly sexualized in their depictions, orchids challenged aesthetic representations, transforming the technical process of botanical illustration while contributing to a false construction of the tropics inevitably leading to affective dissonances among naturalists. Here, theories of color and artistic practice become central to the politics of botanical preservation and display. Chapter Three traces a carnivorous pitcher plant collected by a liminal figure working for the East India Company. The pitcher plant came to crystallize colonial fears of environmental pushback?the phallic, carnivorous plant challenged theories of order while provoking questions about colonial consumption. I end with the largest and rarest plant in the world?the corpse flower. That a flower could actively mimic animal behavior to attract pollinators upended the chain of floral being. Resistant to all forms of collection, preservation, and display, the corpse flower proved to be the ultimate form of tropical nature?s resistance to human intervention and control.2 aPrinceton University.bProgram in History of Science0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342805240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp015m60qv71m03276nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002000164245009900184260005800283300001100341500007800352500004200430500003900472502004800511506006900559506005900628520196900687710004902656773005102705793001202756856015002768856005602918AAI1342810120191111131205.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060018  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428101  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12870  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aPearson, Heath.14aThe Carceral Outside How Privatized Land Produces Racialized Labor in an American Prison Town. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a264 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Biehl, Joao;Perry, Imani.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  a"The Carceral Outside" explores the evolution of a rural town in New Jersey that, over the course of two hundred years of capital accumulation, has transformed from an agricultural hub into a town with four prisons, a regional jail, and three police departments. It examines how the transformation of land over time was related to the search for and exploitation of laborers, and how that relationship between land and labor became racialized, paving the way for a rural "prison town." The study is anchored by a detailed land history of each prison site, beginning in the late-eighteenth century and continuing to the present, and is bolstered by a chronicle of family and life histories based on more than two hundred ethnographic interviews. Additional data were supplied by newspaper archives in the library, local government archives, and published state and federal reports. U.S. "mass incarceration" and the "war on drugs" have been framed primarily as federal responses to deindustrialization driven by a racist backlash to expanded civil rights in the mid-twentieth century. This dissertation challenges that story, arguing instead that the long duree of carceral control and forced labor manifests as a core technique of market democracy. When land changes from "unused," to agriculturally productive, to industrial, to punitive, the laborers change with it: from Indigenous genocide and African (American) slavery, to Japanese-American "internees" in labor camps during WWII, to prison labor and devalued laborers with felonies, to undocumented agricultural laborers from Central and South America. Laborers during these changing eras, in turn, signify and at times foment social divisions especially along lines of race/ethnicity. Historicizing this relationship between privatized land and racialized labor locates ?mass incarceration? as only a current manifestation of market democracy?s continual re/production of a racialized division of laborers.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Anthropology0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342810140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp011v53k078w03966nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002600164245009100190260005800281300001100339500007800350500004200428500002600470502004800496506006900544506005900613520267000672710005303342773005103395793001203446856015003458856005603608AAI1342811620191111131205.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060087  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428116  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12872  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aWetzel, Joshua Lewis.10aStructure-aware Approaches for Deciphering Sequence-specific Protein-DNA Interactions. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a193 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Singh, Mona.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aInteractions between proteins and specific genomic loci are critical to the proper functioning of all cells. The ability of a DNA-binding protein (DBP) to distinguish between its target binding sites and other genomic regions is required for a myriad of crucial functions, including transcriptional regulation, meiotic recombination, chromatin remodeling, and genome organization. However, the fundamental relationship between the amino acid sequence of a DBP and its DNA-binding preferences remains largely elusive.High-throughput experimental technologies for detecting protein-DNA interactions have advanced substantially in the past decade and have enabled measurements for thousands of natural and synthetic DBP variants. However, these technologies typically require sophisticated analyses to uncover intrinsic DNA-binding specificities from the measured signals, often have poorly understood noise and sampling profiles, and provide little insight into the underlying mechanism of interaction. Meanwhile, precise co-complex structural data provide great insight into the mechanistic principles guiding interactions between DBPs and their DNA ligands, albeit at substantially lower throughput. These two types of data are complementary but rarely considered in concert.In this dissertation, I describe novel computational approaches that improve the accuracy and interpretability of inferences derived from high-throughput protein-DNA interaction data, via direct consideration of the underlying protein-DNA structural interaction interface shared across proteins within the same DNA-binding family. First, I describe a systematic exploration of the DNA-binding landscape for Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) proteins, the most abundant DNA-binding family in eukaryotes. Here we inferred the largest set of C2H2-ZF specificities to date and developed a state-of-the-art structurally-inspired method for predicting specificities for novel C2H2-ZFs. Second, I demonstrate how to leverage the large amounts of specificity data available for DBPs to develop a general framework that improves accuracy of high-throughput DNA-binding specificity inferences by jointly considering interaction preferences for groups of proteins from the same DNA-binding family, rewarding global consistency according to an expected similarity measure reflecting family-level structural considerations. Finally, I provide a probabilistic framework for improving interpretability of high-throughput data by mapping inferred specificities of DBPs from the same DNA-binding family onto a common "reference" structural interface model derived from aggregated family-level co-complex data.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Computer Science0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342811640uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01x346d697603537nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001800164245009800182260005800280300001100338500007800349500004200427500003400469502004800503506005900551520230600610710006202916773005102978793001203029856015003041856005603191AAI1342818820191111131205.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060094  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428188  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12873  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aYang, Junnan.10aDesigning Deployment Policies to Maximize the Co-benefits of China's Clean Energy Transition. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a137 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Mauzerall, Denise L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aChina?s rapid economic growth over the past few decades has been fueled by the coal-dominated energy system. The increasing consumption of coal and other fossil fuels has resulted in a dramatic increase in China?s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and worsening ambient air quality. The Chinese government has designed and implemented various deployment policies to support the transition toward significantly less coal and other fossil fuel consumption. My dissertation focuses on the climate, air quality, and industrial growth co-benefits of various deployment policies in China. It includes three analytical chapters.Chapter 2 analyzes the climate, air quality and human health benefits of various solar PV deployment scenarios in China in 2030. I find that deploying distributed PV in the east with inter-provincial transmission maximizes potential CO2 reductions and air quality-related health benefits. Deployment in the east with inter-provincial transmission results in the largest benefits because it maximizes displacement of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants and minimizes PV curtailment, which is more likely to occur without inter-provincial transmission.Chapter 3 analyzes the climate, air quality and human health implications of replacing small heating stoves with gas and electric heating in China. I examine the implications of using gas (conventional gas or coal-based synthetic natural gas (SNG)) and electricity (either resistance heaters or air-source heat pumps) for heating. I find deploying heat pumps as a substitute for small solid fuel stoves for heating has the greatest long-term potential of significant air quality and climate co-benefits as China further decarbonizes its power sector.Chapter 4 analyzes the role of deployment policies in promoting industrial growth in China?s wind, solar PV and Lithium-ion battery industries. I argue that deployment policies are effective to support industrial growth when the end uses of the clean energy technology are relatively few and concentrated. For battery storage technology, I find that there are multiple use cases of storage systems in the power sector, which makes direct subsidization for battery storage systems less effective in promoting the Li-ion battery industry compared to China's wind and solar industries.2 aWoodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342818840uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01sb397c05104414nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002500164245008500189260005800274300001100332500007800343500004200421500003400463502004800497506006900545506005900614520316500673710004403838773005103882793001203933856015003945856001704095AAI1342821420191111131205.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060100  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428214  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12874  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aFraga, Sean Patrick.10aOcean Fever: Water, Trade, and the Shaping of the Terraqueous Pacific Northwest. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a401 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Sandweiss, Martha A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aAmerican interest in Asian trade propelled westward expansion and shaped the Pacific Northwest. In the early nineteenth century, Americans saw the Pacific Coast?s few harbors as portals between the continental interior and the Pacific Ocean, motivating westward expansion under presidents from Thomas Jefferson (who dispatched Lewis and Clark) to James Polk. Access to Pacific harbors structured Polk?s 1846 Oregon Treaty, which divided the Northwest between the United States and Great Britain. In the 1850s and 1860s, Euro-American settlers used steam-powered vessels to police indigenous people and enforce the region?s marine border during a volatile period that included the Stevens treaties, the 1856 Battle of Seattle, the 1858 Fraser River gold rush, and the 1859 Pig War, which started a years-long military standoff between the United States and Britain for control of the San Juan Islands. At the same time, cross-border trade drove support for American annexation of British Columbia. Between 1880 and 1910, four transcontinental railroads, part of an emergent global steam-powered transportation network, built to Northwest harbors to access Pacific trade. (These included Northern Pacific Railroad, Great Northern Railway, and Canadian Pacific Railway.) Boosters celebrated new connections to Asia, promoting Puget Sound as the "gateway to the Orient," even as other white Americans violently opposed the presence of Asian people. Maritime trade powered growth for port cities like Seattle and Tacoma, but brought problems like congested waterfronts and unsafe watercraft, inspiring a local strand of Progressivism to manage marine spaces for public benefit. In the twentieth century, water sustained Seattle?s suburban growth, as developers leveraged local connections provided by the mosquito fleet to build housing?steamboat suburbs, including one named Suquamish?on nearby rural waterfront land.Scholars generally describe American westward expansion in terrestrial terms, as a series of land acquisitions. This dissertation demonstrates that Americans also understood it as a terraqueous process, involving both terrestrial and aquatic areas. A terraqueous perspective on American history reveals that terrestrial stories are frequently entangled with aquatic spaces, "ungrounding" familiar narratives. This approach recovers the role of maritime workers in American territorial acquisition and settlement. It emphasizes the use of technology in border-making, demonstrating how Anglo-Americans used steamboats to counter indigenous maritime societies. It stresses the continuity between nineteenth-century American continental expansion and twentieth-century U.S. Pacific imperialism. And it models terraqueous possibilities for historical geography, showing how local maritime connections sustained urban and suburban growth. By revealing the terraqueous dimensions of American history, this research expands and challenges our understandings of American national incorporation, borders and borderlands, American engagement with the Pacific World, and urban and suburban development. American history looks different from the water?s edge.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of History0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342821440uNO_ARK_FOUND03331nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001700164245004800181260005800229300001100287500007800298500004200376500002700418502004800445506005900493520217600552710004402728773005102772793001202823856015002835856005602985AAI1342829120191111131206.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060117  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428291  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12875  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aSun, Jiming.10aHigh Pressure Superionic Ice Phase Diagram. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a125 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Car, Roberto.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aWater is one of the most common substances in the universe and is found in many different phases. At extremely high temperature and pressure, water ice forms a superionic phase (SI) in which the water molecules dissociate into ions, with the oxygen ions forming a crystal lattice structure and the hydrogen ions flowing through the lattice like a liquid. In this thesis, we present a first-principle study of the high pressure superionic ice phase. We systematically explore the superionic phase diagram and carefully study its physical and chemical properties. As a result of this investigation, we find that superionic ice exists in three different phases differentiating from each other in the structure of the oxygen sublattice. One phase is the BCC-SI phase, which has BCC oxygen sublattice and has been predicted by several groups. We find the BCC-SI phase is stable up to about 250GPa. At higher pressure, BCC-SI transforms via a first order transition to the CP-SI phase. The oxygens form close-packed structures in this phase. CP-SI has also been predicted by other authors, though our predicted transition pressure is significantly higher. Finally, we find a third SI phase, P21/c-SI, which would exist at even higher pressure and it is predicted here for the first time. In addition, we use the imaginary-time path integral technique to study the nuclear quantum effects (NQE). We find the NQE changes the SI ice phase boundaries significantly. Compared to the classical results, NQE makes CP-SI phase more stable and increases the transition pressure from about 1.5TPa to about 1.7TPa. We show that the NQE on the SI phase boundary can be explained by thermodynamic perturbation theory to the lowest order. Lastly, we studied the chemical bonding and the electronic structures of high pressure superionic phases. We computed the distribution of maximally localized Wannier functions centers and showed evidence that the chemical bonding in high pressure ice phases is dominated by ionic interactions. This is very different from the low pressure phases, where the water molecules are intact and the intermolecular interactions are dominated by hydrogen bonds.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Physics0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342829140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01hx11xj04j03701nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001700164245010300181260005800284300001100342500007800353500004200431500002700473502004800500506005900548520248900607710004603096773005103142793001203193856015003205856005603355AAI1342841920191111131206.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060124  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428419  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12876  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aKo, Hsin-Yu.10aFirst-Principles Study on the Structural and Thermal Properties of Molecular Crystals and Liquids. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a190 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Car, Roberto.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHybrid density functional theory (DFT) is widely used to obtain a semi-quantitative understanding of the electronic structures of isolated molecular clusters; however, it has limited applicability to large molecules and complex condensed-phase materials due to its high computational cost. To overcome this difficulty, a linear-scaling algorithm based on maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWF) can be employed.In the first part of this thesis, we present a detailed discussion on the theory, real-space implementation, and performance of this algorithm for enabling large-scale condensed-phase hybrid DFT based ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations under realistic isobaric-isothermal (NpT) conditions. For the theory aspect, we discuss how the MLWF-based linear-scaling approach can be integrated into the Car-Parrinello AIMD framework. For our implementation (named exx module), we introduced several features to enable massive parallelization using hybrid MPI/OpenMP technologies, including custom data distribution scheme for MLWFs, static load balancing algorithm, and reusable proto-subdomains to exploit the localization in MLWF representation. Based on performance test using realistic condensed-phase liquid water systems (H2O)64, (H 2O)128, and (H2O)256, we find the  exx module to be quite efficient and scalable, hence making a hybrid DFT based AIMD simulation feasible.In the second part, we apply the exx module to study molecular crystals and liquids. The first application is to simulate the ice I h, II, and III phases using AIMD at the dispersion-inclusive hybrid DFT level at their experimental triple point (238 K, 2.1 kbar). In the second application, we exploit the computational efficiency and scalability of our  exx module in conjunction with leadership level supercomputers to perform path-integral AIMD (PI-AIMD) simulations on liquid water (300 K) and ice Ih (273 K) both under ambient pressure (1.0 bar) at dispersion-inclusive hybrid DFT level. We identify this level of theory provides a quite accurate description to water. From the resulting trajectory, we also find that the nuclear quantum fluctuation with autoprotolysis-type distortion promotes orbital localization. In the third application, we explore how anharmonicity, nuclear quantum effects (NQE), many-body dispersion interactions, and Pauli repulsion influence thermal properties of dispersion-bound molecular crystals using pyridine and similar organic molecular crystals.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Chemistry0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342841940uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01d504rp13204524nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002800164245011900192260005800311300001000369500007800379500004200457500002600499502004800525506005900573520325600632710007703888773005103965793001204016856015004028856005604178AAI1342842020191111131206.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060131  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428420  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12877  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aZamalloa, Jose Antonio.10aPrediction of Cancer Phenotypes Through Machine Learning Approaches: From Gene Modularity to Deep Neural Networks. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a94 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Singh, Mona.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe current genomics data influx is transforming healthcare by enabling precise diagnoses and individualized treatments. This is especially true for cancer, where we have genome sequencing and gene expression data across numerous individuals, along with measurements of drug response across hundreds of cancer cell lines. Computational, statistical and machine learning methods play an essential role in analyzing these data in order to gain medically relevant insights. In this dissertation, I describe statistical and machine learning approaches to enable better stratification of cancer subtypes and predict therapy outcomes for individuals with cancer.First, I introduce Deep Pharmacogenomic Modules (Deep-PGMs), a framework to predict drug response outcomes for tumor samples using drug features and gene expression data. Genome expression signatures are a great aid for predicting whether a particular therapy may be beneficial for a specific cancer tumor. Traditional ma- chine learning approaches to predict the effect of a cancer drug on a tumor typically focus on the expression levels of either certain key cancer-relevant genes or of all genes. While genomic data can aid in describing the disease state of an individual by looking at isolated gene entities, genes in cells tend to act in concert to perform their functions. My approach takes advantage of the modular nature of gene regulation to build a reduced feature space that describes the cellular state of a tumor. I take advantage of unsupervised machine learning methods to build genomic and non-genomic feature spaces. I construct a deep neural network pipeline to predict drug efficacy outcomes on tumor cell line samples. I demonstrate that my framework outperforms traditional machine learning approaches that do not take advantage of the modular structure of gene expression data sets. I further apply my method to clinical trial data and demonstrate its performance. I find that featurizing genomic data through prior knowledge about cellulary modularity, accompanied with a robust deep learning pipeline, is a powerful method for predicting the disease outcome of novel cancer therapeutics.In the second part of my thesis, I develop classifiers to identify two breast cancer subtypes. First, I describe an accurate Claudin-low (CL) molecular subtype predictor based on gene expression data. This particular subtype has poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Via experiments in mice along with analysis of human breast cancer data, my collaborators and I linked individuals with CL breast cancer to elevated levels of miR-199a. This evidence further supported the high levels of miR-199a in mice tumors and helped characterize the miR-199a-LCOR-IFN axis in tumor initiation. Next, I developed a hysteretic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) classifier. I use experimental data from TGF-? induced EMT mouse mammary tumor cells to find genes that are indicative of the hysteretic EMT phenotype. The uncovered genes in my model correlate well with metastatic phenotypes in clinical datasets, particularly in patients with metastatic lung cancer, suggesting that EMT-induced mice mammary tumor cells can help elucidate clinically relevant genes important in metastasis.2 aPrinceton University.bProgram in Quantitative and Computational Biology0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342842040uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp018c97kt22j04333nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001500164245010600179260005800285300001100343500007800354500004200432500003500474502004800509506005900557520314900616710004803765773005103813793001203864856015003876856001704026AAI1342844820191111131206.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060148  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428448  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12878  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aWu, Wenbo.10aShort Period Body Waves Unveil Deep Earth's Small-Scale Structure: From a Subducted Slab to the Core. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a182 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Irving, Jessica C.

Seismic imaging can provide critical constraints on its thermochemical state. Although great progress has been made on large-scale seismic imaging, imaging small-scale structures is more difficult due to more complex wave propagation effects for short period waves. In this dissertation, I investigate several types of short period signals traveling in the deep Earth and use their properties to constrain the structure in Earth's inner core, outer core and the subducted oceanic crust of the Pacific plate beneath NE Japan.Strong small-scale (a few km) volumetric heterogeneities in the inner core have been detected using short period (?1 s) inner core scattering (ICS), termed PKiKP coda, in previous studies. However, most of these data sampled the inner core's "eastern hemisphere". I observed PKiKP and its coda waves sampling the "western hemisphere" and confirmed small-scale heterogeneities in the inner core's "western hemisphere". However, the ICS from "western hemisphere" is weaker than that from the "eastern hemisphere". This hemispherical difference, or a regional variation, is also seen other properties of the inner core, such as anisotropy and average compressional wave velocity, Vp.Previous studies of body waves have imaged a low Vp layer at the top of outer core indicating a stratified layer. To better resolve this low Vp layer, I developed a novel approach using array data to iteratively isolate individual SmKS (m = 3, 4 and 5) signals and better measured SmKS-SKKS differential travel times. I successfully used this method to measure SmKS travel time delays. I also applied this iterative scheme on SPECFEM3D globe synthetic SmKS seismograms to investigate the effects of 3D mantle structure. The results indicate that 3D mantle structure effects are not negligible in our data and could bias the estimation of Vp in the uppermost outer core. After 3D mantle structure corrections, there are still substantial time delays for supporting a low Vp at the top of Earth's outer core, relative to the PREM.Subducted oceanic crust plays an important role in material recycling (e.g. water) and the genesis of seismicity. Oceanic crust is usually thinner than 10 km and difficult to image. I observed seismic multi-pathing effects in the subduction zone below NE Japan. These multi-pathing effects are controlled by a seismic attenuation contrast between the back-arc mantle wedge and subducted crust. I used an oceanic crust model based on mineral-physics and conducted SPECFEM2D numerical simulations to investigate these multi-pathing effects. My results support a 9% Vp increase in the oceanic crust at a depth of 130?150 km due to the (lawsonite, talc)-eclogite transition.Here I demonstrated three examples of using short period body waves to image deep Earth's small-scale structure. A large amount of short period data accumulated in the last decades is still awaiting seismological analysis. Deciphering these signals will tremendously improve our understanding of small-scale structure in the deep Earth.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Geosciences0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342844840uNO_ARK_FOUND03147nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002000164245007400184260005800258300001100316500007800327500004200405500002800447502004800475506006700523506005900590520187900649710004802528773005102576793001202627856015002639856005602789AAI1342846220191111131207.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060155  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428462  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12879  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aSmith, James A.10aSeismic Imaging of Underground Tunnels Using Full-Waveform Inversion. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a180 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Tromp, Jeroen.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThere are a variety of challenges when applying full-waveform inversion to underground tunnels in the near-surface. One challenge is in efficiently handling large amounts of seismic data on high-performance computing machines. Big data-sets allow for more measurements to be made that can resolve structures at unprecedented resolution. Utilizing these data-sets in seismic inversion work-flows requires developing new technologies that are fast, adaptable, and reproducible. The adaptable seismic data format (ASDF) is a modern data format that offers an organized, standards-based, and provenance-enhanced tool for earthquake seismology.A second challenge is generating accurate three-dimensional images of small subsurface voids near the surface. In advancing seismic imaging in the near-surface regime, three-dimensional elastic full-waveform inversion is applied to a known underground tunnel located in a desert geology at a depth of approximately 10 m. A set of successful experiments are presented that approximately image the underground tunnel in three-dimensions.A third challenge is in estimating the source time function from field data. Since the recorded data includes the effect of the source, the more accurate the estimate of the seismic source, the more accurate the model of the inverted subsurface velocity structure. A linear inversion method is applied for inverting for the source time signature from recorded sensor data. The inverted source is verified by comparing it with the measured accelerometer data from the field site.A fourth challenge is in incorporating anelastic attenuation into the inversion workflow. The range of possible parameter values for attenuation are constrained using the recorded data from the tunnel site. A set of 2D numerical experiments are presented that invert for attenuation directly in acoustic and elastic media.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Geosciences0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342846240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp010v838336x03622nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002000164245005500184260005800239300001100297500007800308500004200386500002700428502004800455506006900503506006700572506005900639520229600698710004502994773005103039793001203090856015003102856005603252AAI1342861820191111131207.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060162  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428618  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12880  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aEnamorado, Ted.10aEssays on Data Integration in the Social Sciences. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a166 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Imai, Kosuke.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation is a collection of three essays that deal with the challenges social scientists face when trying to integrate information from multiple sources.The first chapter focuses on technical aspects of data integration. Specifically, when a unique identifier that unambiguously links records is not available, merging datasets can be a difficult task. Probabilistic record linkage (PRL) aims to solve this problem by providing a principled framework. I propose an active learning algorithm for PRL, which incorporates human judgment. Using data where a unique identifier is available for validation, I find that the proposed method bolsters the accuracy of the merging process. In addition, I show that the proposed method can recover estimates that are indistinguishable from those obtained from a more extensive and time-consuming manual review.The second chapter uses data from multiple sources to study the impact of electoral rules on coalition building. To overcome endogeneity concerns, I exploit an arbitrary change in electoral rules across municipalities in Brazil and study its impact on pre-electoral coalitions (PECs). I find that in municipalities where elections are conducted using a dual-ballot system, the median number of parties in a given PEC is smaller than in those municipalities that use a single-ballot system. In addition, this reduction in the size of PECs is associated with an increase in the total number of candidates. These findings are consistent with theories that emphasize the opportunities for strategic behavior under a dual-ballot system.Finally, the third chapter (co-authored with Svetlana Kosterina) combines information from multiple sources to study ethnic voting. We show that local ethnic geography affects ethnic voting by incentivizing voters of an ethnicity that finds itself in the minority to misrepresent its preferences. We provide empirical evidence for our claim using the data from the Afrobarometer survey in Ghana to measure the voters' beliefs that they are likely to face adverse consequences for expressing their political preferences. Using geocoded data from Afrobarometer, as well as data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, we find no evidence for local public goods provision as an alternative mechanism.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Politics0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342861840uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01w3763956w03494nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002400164245007800188260005800266300001100324500007800335500004200413500003400455502004800489506006900537506006700606506005900673520213400732710004502866773005102911793001202962856015002974856005603124AAI1342863420191111131207.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060179  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13428634  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12882  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aHulme Kozey, Emily.10aPhilosophia and Philotechnia: The Techne Theme in the Platonic Dialogues. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a212 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Wildberg, Christian.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  a"Good God! You never shut up about cobblers and fullers and cooks and doctors!" So Callicles charges Plato's Socrates with an excessive fascination with the ????? in the Gorgias (491a). Callicles certainly has a point: Plato refers to ????? ("art," "craft," "profession," "expertise") hundreds of times in the dialogues, while also portraying Socrates as a former ???? o???o? ("craftsman," "professional") himself (Alc. 1.121a; Euthphr. 11c).In my dissertation, I examine the philosophical importance of ????? in Plato. The first part discusses the idea of ????? in the wider Greek world of the fifth and fourth centuries. Chapter one shows how Plato connects Socrates with the god of craft, Hephaistos, and how this is related to the Athenian setting of the dialogues. The second chapter uses literary, art historical, and epigraphic sources to identify four major features of a ?????: (I) connection with low social status; (II) teachability; (III) specialization; (IV) rationality.The second part of the dissertation turns to Plato proper. The third chapter examines the important question of how Plato's terms for crafts, knowledge, learning, and professions are structured. Contrary to previous work that has asserted the equivalence of ????? and ????????, I argue that ???????? picks up on the teachable, intellectual component of ?????. Against a common misconception, I argue that the opposite of ????? for Plato is not ???????? ("experience," "practice") but ??????o? ("hobby") and that this contrast, and the one made by the terms for the individuals who pursue each of these (????o??? o?/???????, "professional"/ "amateur"), is central to Plato's conception of what makes something a true ?????. For Plato, mere book knowledge will not be enough: extensive practice or experience is, in fact, an absolute requirement for true mastery of a given field. The fourth and fifth chapters then turn to this theme in two related contexts. First, I assess how Plato portrays the sophists as practitioners of pseudo-??????; and then, in the final chapter, I turn to the Republic, where philosophy itself is construed as a ?????.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Classics0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1342863440uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01rb68xf65g03052nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002300164245008800187260005800275300001100333500007800344500004200422500003100464502004800495506006900543506006700612506005900679520168500738710004602423773005102469793001202520856015002532856005602682AAI1380542720191111131207.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060186  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13805427  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12883  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aSybblis, Martin W.10aOpen for Business: A Socio-Legal Analysis of Economic Development in the Caribbean. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a296 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Scheppele, Kim L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation offers a novel way to understand how legal change occurs in the corporate and commercial context. It suggests that legal professionals, particularly commercial lawyers, are capable of enhancing the state's capacity for law reform in instances where legal rules are seen as a pathway to economic prosperity. They and other community leaders (typically political and business elites), however, are influenced in their reform efforts by the community economic identities ("CEIs") they have developed with respect to chosen commercial activities within their jurisdiction. CEIs affect how those who make the crucial development decisions think about the commercial activities and industries in their community (city, state, country or region), and these identities in turn shape what seem like logical choices for that community.This project makes two contributions to the sociology of law and economic development. First, it suggests that the scholarly understanding of "state capacity" should be expanded to include the availability and role of private sector commercial lawyers who can help a state promote and achieve commercial law reforms. Second, the dissertation introduces the concept of CEI into the academic discourse on the relationship between law and economic development. It explores the role commercial lawyers and CEI have played in commercial law reform in the Commonwealth Caribbean post-colonies of Barbados and Jamaica. The institutional similarities between the two countries and the divergent paths they have taken in their approach to commercial law reform make them attractive sites for better understanding the determinants of legal change.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Sociology0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380542740uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01mp48sg56r03152nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100002200164245008900186260005800275300001100333500007800344500004200422500002900464502004800493506006900541506005900610520184300669710006902512773005102581793001202632856015002644856005602794AAI1380543120191111131207.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060193  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13805431  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12884  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aBalloni, Massimo.10aFor an Encyclopedia of the Living: Collective Creativity and the Early Soviet Novel. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a217 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Vinitsky, Ilya.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe goal of this dissertation is to consider the collective literary practices of the first fifteen years of the Soviet Union in order to suggest a shift in the proletariat from object to author of its own narrative discourse and identify the aesthetic strategies that made such a transition possible. In this sense, collective creativity became one of the most debated devices of its time. By looking at the novel as a large case study, I show how this literary genre had to be rethought to depict the new social order and accommodate the proletariat as the new protagonist in the historical process. As an overarching metaphor, I deploy a variation of the old dualism between the universal and the particular understood more technically, however, as reproducibility vs specificity. To lay bare this shift in the narrative discourse of the proletariat, I investigate the process by which, in the novel, the chaotic crowds of the Revolutionary years gained proletarian consciousness and became masses charged with building Communism. I trace the trajectory that leads from the collapse of the biography of the Civil War hero to History of Factories and Plants, a series of volumes in which the divide between the professional writer and the proletarian worker has been erased, the biography of the collective is narrated, and a Soviet epos is created. While, on the narrative level, war and the machine functioned as the main organizing principles of the crowd in the first decade following the Revolution, literary practice itself became the ultimate organizer of the collective in the early 1930s. Far from being antithetical to the cult of personality prominent in the Stalinist years, it is precisely these collective endeavors that, I claim, laid the groundwork for the poetics of Socialist Realism and the advent of the Soviet Hero.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Slavic Languages and Literatures0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380543140uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01gx41mm65503629nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002400140100001900164245008600183260005800269300001100327500007800338500004200416500002800458502004800486506005900534520241800593710005903011773005103070793001203121856015003133856005603283AAI1380609320191111131208.5191111s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060209  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13806093  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12886  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjP1 aZhang, Jintao.10aExploring Mixed-Signal Computation for Energy Aggressive Interface Architectures. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a133 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Verma, Naveen.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aEmbedded sensor signals from an increasing variety of sources are enabling a broad range of intelligent systems. For instance, the systems aim to gain information about the state of the world, including its human inhabitants. However, the extraction of such information from embedded signals is challenging, since the signals naturally arise from complex physics of real-world processes. Machine-learning algorithms are addressing this challenge by enabling the construction of models for inferences from such complex signals, by using the data themselves. A key focus thus becomes the realization of such algorithms in highly energy-constrained sensing devices, despite the increasing compute complexity of the algorithms. In energy-constrained systems, a conventional way to resolve this problem is to employ application-specific circuits.In this thesis, we have proposed using mixed-signal computation within unconventional architectures to overcome fundamental limitations that are faced in traditional digital application-specific architectures. But to maximize energy efficiency, the new architectures must avoid overheads typically incurred to correct mixed-signal circuit non-idealities. In order to maintain high overall system level performance, we also exploit the machine-learning approach of Data-Driven Hardware Resilience (DDHR), which involves statistical learning using data processed by the non-ideal circuits themselves, such that the machine-learning model optimally adapts to the non-idealities. This leads to substantial hardware-level relaxation and thus the potential for highly efficient system implementations.To demonstrate our ideas, multiple hardware designs that are tested via silicon-CMOS prototypes are demonstrated. We first present a Time-domain Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) accelerator, to show the idea of DDHR in an embedded seizure detection system when overcoming analog non-idealities. Then, a SAR-ADC based matrix multiplier, referred to as the Matrix-Multiplying ADC (MMADC), is demonstrated as an example for mixed-signal computing. Then, an SRAM-based strong classifier (ClassRAM) is demonstrated. Further, system-level trade-offs and specialized algorithms are analyzed and developed, based on the in-memory architecture extended from ClassRAM, which enhance the application-level computational scalability of the architectures.2 aPrinceton University.bDept. of Electrical Engineering0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380609340uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01c534fr731
