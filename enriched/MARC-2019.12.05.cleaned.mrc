Such data is likely to contain sensitive information and thus needs to be obfuscated prior to release, to protect privacy. However, existing statistical data privacy mechanisms in the security community have several weaknesses: 1) they are limited in protecting sensitive information in the static scenario, and can not be generally applied to accommodate temporal dynamics. With the increasing development of data science, a large amount of sensitive data such as personal social relationships are becoming public, making the privacy concerns of a time series of data more and more challenging; 2) these privacy mechanisms do not explicitly capture correlations, leaving open the possibility of inference attacks. In many real world scenarios, the data tuple dependence/ correlation occurs naturally in datasets due to social, behavioral and genetic interactions between users; 3) there are very few practical guidelines on how to apply existing statistical privacy notions in practice, and a key challenge is how to set an appropriate value for the privacy parameters.In this thesis, we aim to overcome these weaknesses to provide privacy guarantees for protecting dynamic data structures, dependent (correlated) data structures. We also aim to discover useful and interpretable guidelines for selecting proper values of parameters in the state-of-the-art privacy-preserving frameworks. Furthermore, we investigate how an auxiliary information?in the form of prior distribution of the database and correlation across records and time?can influence the proper choice of the privacy parameters. Specifically, we 1) first propose the design of a privacy-preserving system called LinkMirage, that mediates access to dynamic social relationships in social networks, while effectively supporting social graph-based data analytics; 2) explicitly incorporate structural properties of data into current differential privacy metrics and mechanisms, to enable privacy-preserving data analytics for dependent/correlated data; and 3) finally provide a quantitative analysis of how hypothesis testing can guide the choice of the privacy parameters in an interpretable manner for differential privacy and other statistical privacy frameworks.Overall, our work aims to place the field of statistical data privacy on a firm analytic foundation that is coupled with the design of practical systems.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Electrical Engineering)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380666340uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp017d278w81g03397nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100002500169245006200194260005800256300001100314500007800325500004200403500002800445502004800473506006900521506006700590506005900657520202800716710007002744773005102814793001202865856015002877856005603027AAI1380674020190916110845.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060223  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13806740  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12888  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aVannucchi, Federica.10aA Disciplinary Mechanism: The Milan Triennale, 1964?1973. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a442 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Allais, Lucia.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation traces the reform of architecture as a discipline in postwar Italy by examining one particular public institution in which architecture, its theorists, and its designers, directly confronted both public and political power: the Milan Triennale (officially known as the International Exhibition of Decorative Arts and Modern Architecture). In the 1960s and early 1970s, the dissertation argues, the Milan Triennale functioned as a "disciplinary mechanism," that is, as a laboratory and testing ground for reshaping the relationship of architecture in both its theoretical and practical dimensions to politics. This relationship to power is examined through the lens of the tension between ideas presented at the exhibition and the nature of the Milanese institution as both executor of government resolutions and agent of the public's will. Against the backdrop of Italy's first abrupt period of economic unrest after World War Two, an interruption in the politics of centrismo (the center-right coalition that dominated Italy from 1947 to 1962), uprisings by students and workers, and the onset of a new era of reformism, the curators of three seminal exhibitions tested architecture as a means of political resistance against power and thereby refused to comply with the long-standing alliance between the Milan Triennale and the government. The exhibitions Tempo libero (Leisure) (1964) curated by Umberto Eco and Vittorio Gregotti, Grande numero (Greater Number) (1968) curated by Giancarlo De Carlo, and Architettura-citta  (Architecture-City) (1973) curated by Aldo Rossi led to a new understanding of architecture as a discipline that existed both "within and against" political power, to borrow an expression coined by neo-Marxist philosopher Mario Tronti. This dissertation follows the struggles of architects and critics as they operated "within" an institutional setting that was to endow their ideas with greater power, but also declared themselves as being "against" this very power structure.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(School of Architecture)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380674040uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp013n204188203390nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100001700169245003500186260005800221300001100279500007800290500004200368500002800410502004800438506005900486520218400545710010202729773005102831793001202882856015002894856005603044AAI1380675820190916110846.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060230  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13806758  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12889  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aWang, Peiqi.10aFinite State Mean Field Games. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a222 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Carmona, Rene.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMean field game is a powerful framework for studying the strategic interactions within a large population of rational agents. Although existing research has predominantly relied on diffusion models to depict agents' states, numerous applications, such as epidemic control and botnet defense, can best be modeled by systems of particles in discrete state space. This thesis tackles finite state mean field games. In the first part of the thesis, we develop a probabilistic approach for finite state mean field games. Based on the weak formulation of optimal control, the approach accommodates the interactions through the players' strategies and flexible information structures.The second part of the thesis is devoted to finite state mean field games involving a player possessing dominating influence. Two different mechanisms are explored. We first study a form of Stackelberg games, in which the dominating player, referred to as principal, moves first and chooses its strategy which impacts the dynamics and objective functions of every remaining player, referred to as agent. Having observed the principal's strategy, the agents reach a Nash equilibrium. We seek optimal strategies of the principal, whose objective function depends on the statistical distribution of the agents' states in equilibrium. Using the weak formulation of finite state mean field games developed previously in the thesis, we transform the principal's optimization problem into a McKean-Vlasov control problem, and provide a semi-explicit solution under the assumptions of linear transition rate, quadratic cost and risk-neutral utility.In the second model, we assume that all players move simultaneously and we study Nash equilibria formed jointly by major and minor players. We introduce finite player games and derive mean field game formulation in the limit of infinitely many minor players. In this limit, we characterize the best responses of major and minor players via viscosity solutions of HJB equations, and we prove existence of Nash equilibria under reasonable assumptions. We also derive approximate Nash equilibria for the finite player game from the solution of the mean field game.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Operations Research and Financial Engineering)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380675840uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01zw12z808g03330nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100002400169245011800193260005800311300001100369500007800380500004200458500002800500502004800528506005900576520205700635710007902692773005102771793001202822856015002834856005602984AAI1380682420190916110846.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060247  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13806824  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12891  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aKerner, Ross Allen.10aChemistry of Lead Halide Perovskites: Aspects of Solution-Gelation and Acid-Base Reactions with Aliphatic Amines. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a138 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Rand, Barry P.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMetal halide perovskites are an exciting and promising class of materials for optoelectronic device applications. Advancement of perovskite photovoltaic and light emitting diode lab-scale efficiencies have increased to or exceeded the performance of many established semiconductor technologies, but on a much shorter time scale. The rapid evolution of halide perovskite technology owes largely to the knowledge base gained from previous thin film technologies as well as a large amount of empirical improvements in processing and device architecture. However, there exist several barriers to commercialization of halide perovskites, mainly, long-term material stability and device operation. These challenges stem from the strong chemical reactivity of halide perovskite materials. Reactions taking place in solution while processing and in the solid-state during device fabrication/characterization lead to many complications and potentially obfuscate interpretation of results. These unique properties also make perovskites a rich platform by which to study many interesting and novel photo-electrochemical phenomena. In this thesis, we study the chemical properties of halide perovskites elucidating aspects of solution-gelation chemistry, the effect of stoichiometry on nano-scale composition, acid-base reactions with simple additives in solution, and solid-state reduction-oxidation reactions influencing electrochemical stability. Fundamental insight gained from these detailed studies facilitate significant improvements targeting specific applications such as fabricating ultrasmooth, ultrathin perovskite films with high emissivity and exploiting impurity chemistry at optimal concentrations leading to defect passivation. These results demonstrate the benefits of identifying chemical reaction mechanisms relevant to halide perovskites. Understanding and predicting how perovskites will react with other material systems and conditions is paramount for progressing the field and overcoming challenges to commercialization of this technology.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Electrical Engineering)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380682440uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01v405sd17003567nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100002200169245002200191260005800213300001100271500007800282500004200360500004400402502004800446506006900494506005900563520231200622710006202934773005102996793001203047856015003059856005603209AAI1380705320190916110846.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060254  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13807053  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12892  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aPhillips, Reuben.10aBrahms as Reader. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a289 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Agawu, V.

Drawing on archival research undertaken in Vienna, I argue that Brahms's early aesthetic worldview was fundamentally shaped by his devotion to reading. The later chapters of the dissertation draw on key works of German Romantic literature to contextualize two of Brahms's singular offerings in the fields of chamber music and song.Part 1 provides the first comprehensive investigation of an important source for evidence of Brahms's early reading habits: his notebooks of literary quotations known?since their abridged publication in 1909?as Des jungen Kreislers Schatzkastlein. Chapter 1 situates Brahms's quotation collection in three contexts, considering biographical representations of Brahms as a reader, the role played by Robert Schumann in shaping Brahms's literary enthusiasms, and the elevated status afforded to the activity of reading in German culture of the mid nineteenth century. Chapter 2 provides a thematic summary of the notebook entries, suggesting that for Brahms the process of copying out quotations served as a means of meditating on important ideas about the role of art in society, genius, originality, and artistic technique. An appendix provides a transcription of surviving source materials from copies preserved in the Wienbibliothek im Rathaus.In the second part of the dissertation I enlist some of Brahms's beloved works of German Romantic literature in the examination of two compositions from the 1860s: the Trio for Piano, Violin, and Waldhorn, op. 40, and the Magelone Romanzen, op. 33. Following the lead of early critics, Chapter 3 considers the Horn Trio from the perspectives of affect and musical temporality in relation to the literary topos  of the Romantic horn call. Chapter 4 offers a literary and music-analytical account of the Magelone Romanzen, homing in on Brahms's formally innovative treatment of Tieck's poetic texts. By exploring these works as imaginative musical responses to themes and motifs central to the literature of German Romanticism, this pair of close readings demonstrates some of the ways in which Brahms's youthful reading fed his mature creativity.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Music)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380705340uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01qf85nf09903408nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100002900169245008200198260005800280300001100338500007800349500004200427500003400469502004800503506006900551506005900620520209300679710006502772773005102837793001202888856015002900856005603050AAI1380714720190916110846.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060261  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13807147  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12893  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aPetkas, Alexander James.10aSynesius of Cyrene and the Politics of the Late Antique Philosophical Letter. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a311 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Wildberg, Christian.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation is a study of the Greek letter collection of Synesius of Cyrene (ca. 370?415 AD) as the key to his literary oeuvre; I argue that the epistles were a project of political philosophy. Synesius was a Neoplatonist philosopher, student of Hypatia of Alexandria, and eventually became the Metropolitan Bishop of Libya. His letters attest to a community of philosophical friends spread across Libya, Egypt, Syria, and Constantinople, a group which included both pagans and Christians. Synesius' letters drew on a philosophical epistolary tradition which can be meaningfully traced back to Plato and Isocrates in 4th century B.C. Athens. His epistles, like those of near contemporaries Gregory of Nazianzus and emperor Julian, participate in the public culture of the so-called Second Sophistic of the high Roman empire, a context still relevant in the late antique east. Contemporary Neoplatonic philosophers such as Julian, Themistius, Syrianus, and Eunapius would have seen political philosophy as an applied, or practical, activity, in which the deployment of rhetoric for the good of the state was central. In carrying out his political philosophy, Synesius tried to promote the honor, or value, of his own version of philosophy against competing alternatives, especially various forms of Christian asceticism. His letters construct for his community an alternative imaginary space built on classical topography, as an alternative to the late antique city. Synesius' learned classicism was driven by moral and philosophical imperatives attested in other writings of his, and was an earnest response to his unique late antique situation, which included Evagrius of Pontus and the Origenist controversy. Letters from his episcopacy show his attempt to reimagine contemporary realities in classical terms, as he points out continuities where others see change, and contradictions where others see harmony. His letters thus illuminate the values and preoccupations of a less known but important sector of late antique Hellenic society, in which Hypatia was an important player.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Classics)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380714740uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01kp78gk18d03726nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100003200169245011400201260005800315300001100373500007800384500004200462500003000504502004800534506006900582506006700651506005900718520230400777710006203081773005103143793001203194856015003206856005603356AAI1380718020190916110846.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060278  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13807180  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12894  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aMatthay, Christopher David.14aThe Classical-period Development Section: Compositional Strategies of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a428 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Agawu, Victor K.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe development section has been described as the most characteristic feature of Classical-period sonata form, as that which distinguishes sonata form from related forms of the period. It has been called "the locus of variety and motion," "the appointed field for the tournament of tonalities," and, borrowing from dramatic theory, "the intrigue," or "the knot." Its function has been described variously as that of unfolding, elaboration, intensification, and digression. Of the three parts of sonata form, the development is, both tonally and in its treatment of thematic material, the least predictable and the most variable from work to work.This dissertation explores rhetorical and harmonic strategies of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schubert for beginning and ending the development, and, in Mozart's early sonata-form movements, for structuring the development as a whole. The project engages with the recent theories of Classical-Period form developed by William Caplin and by James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy; with the less schematic approaches to form of Charles Rosen, Leonard Ratner, and Donald Francis Tovey; and with eighteenth- and nineteenth-century theories of form and of harmony, including those of Riepel, Koch, Reicha, Marx, and Riemann. The approach taken attempts to balance taxonomy and interpretation, and is especially concerned to describe the effects produced by the given strategies in their various realizations in particular works.Chapter 1 describes a beginning strategy often used by Beethoven in his piano sonatas, that of opening the development with a transformed, "dissolving" statement of the work's main theme. Chapter 2 explores a contrasting strategy used by Mozart in several of his middle- and late-period works, a strategy of beginning the development with a tight-knit new theme. Chapters 3 and 4 describe modulatory pathways used in High-Classical-period works to lead out of the key of the end of the exposition, and Chapters 5 and 6 describe retransitional strategies in sonata-form movements of the 1760s?1770s and 1780s?1810s, respectively. Chapter 7 describes three of Mozart's strategies for structuring the development as a whole in his early sonata-form movements, and compares these with related strategies of Haydn and Johann Christian Bach.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Music)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380718040uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01fx719q27t03552nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100003200169245006900201260005800270300001100328500007800339500004200417500002600459502004800485506006700533506005900600520224800659710007402907773005102981793001203032856015003044856005603194AAI1380905520190916110846.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060285  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13809055  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12895  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aGramespacher, Josef Andrew.10aDesign and Application of Conditionally Activated Split Inteins. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a174 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Muir, Tom W.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe discovery and characterization of inteins has led to the development of powerful applications capable of modulating protein structure and function through protein splicing. However, while inteins have found great utility  in-vitro with protein semi-synthesis applications, their use as tools to modify proteins in living systems has been limited by the-auto catalytic nature of the splicing reaction, which makes temporal control of their activity difficult. To address this issue, a variety of conditional protein splicing (CPS) methods have been developed to try and regulate the splicing reaction so that intein activity can be activated only upon addition of a specified trigger. However, these CPS methods have largely relied on inteins that suffer from a variety of unfavorable characteristics that constrain their broader utility, including slow splicing kinetics, poor stability, and stringent extein dependency. In contrast, the recently characterized fast splicing split inteins such as the DnaE intein Npu, are less susceptible to these limitations. Therefore, CPS methods based on naturally split fast splicing inteins should help to make in-cell intein based tools more broadly accessible. This thesis attempts to address this issue by utilizing a basic mechanistic understanding of how the split intein Npu assembles and splices to develop intein zymogens, the first CPS method that effectively controls the association and splicing of multiple fast splicing split inteins while remaining amenable to a diverse set of triggers. Utilizing our understanding of how the caged inteins function, we then developed a general method that can be easily and effectively applied to increase expression and functionality of split N-inteins and split protein-intein fusions, which are otherwise prone to aggregation. Lastly, we further engineer the intein zymogens so that close proximity of the caged intein fragments can be used to overcome splicing inhibition, paving the road for applications that have both temporal and spatial control over protein function. In combination, these methods should make it possible to develop previously impractical or intractable intein based applications and generally expand their utility in cells.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Molecular Biology)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380905540uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01b5644v34103042nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100002800169245007500197260005800272300001100330500007800341500004200419500003200461502004800493506005900541520180900600710007402409773005102483793001202534856015002546856005602696AAI1380915720190916110846.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060292  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13809157  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12896  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aMcCready, Amelia Renee.10aQuorum-sensing Receptor-Ligand Interactions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a133 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Bassler, Bonnie L.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aQuorum sensing is a cell-to-cell communication mechanism that bacteria use to orchestrate collective behaviors. Quorum sensing relies on the production, release, accumulation, and detection of extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses multiple quorum-sensing systems, each composed of a receptor-autoinducer pair. Two of the P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing receptors, LasR and RhlR, are canonical LuxR-type receptors, meaning that they closely resemble the founding quorum-sensing receptor, as well as quorum-sensing receptors present in other species of Gram-negative bacteria. The cognate autoinducers for LuxR-type receptors are homoserine lactones. When bound to their ligands, LuxR-type receptors function as transcription factors that activate hundreds of genes underpinning collective behaviors. This work explores LasR and RhlR ligand binding preferences to understand how each of these receptors interacts with cognate and non-cognate ligands and how receptor-ligand interactions drive regulation of downstream quorum-sensing products. First, the work shows how LasR distinguishes between similar homoserine lactones as well as how LasR preferentially selects its own ligand from a mixture of related molecules. Second, the work reports RhlR ligand-independent mutants that display constitutive activity in vivo, providing insight into the enigmatic RhlR structure. Furthermore, the research demonstrates how the activities of RhlR ligand-independent mutants are kept in check with respect to regulation of quorum-sensing products. Finally, this thesis uses a RhlR ligand-independent mutant to reveal how RhlR works in conjunction with the PqsE thioesterase to regulate the production of the critical virulence factor pyocyanin.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Molecular Biology)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380915740uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp016d570041c03533nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100001700169245008300186260005800269300001100327500007800338500004200416500003100458502004800489506005900537520228500596710009302881773005102974793001203025856015003037856005603187AAI1380940620190916110846.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060308  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13809406  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12897  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aChen, Qiang.10aStimulated Raman Back-Scattering and Self-Guiding of Femtosecond Laser Pulses. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a161 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Suckewer, Szymon.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aPlasma has been proposed as the amplification medium for the next generation of ultra-high intensity lasers as it can sustain several orders of magnitude higher intensities than the thermal damage threshold of the solid-state optical elements, which is below 1012Wcm-2. Plasma-based Stimulated Raman Back-Scattering, SRBS, also known as Raman Amplification, seems to be a very efficient approach, although an energy transfer efficiency to the amplified seed did not reach 10% yet.Experiments and simulations on increasing efficiency and exploring better control of SRBS seed amplification were conducted at Princeton University. For example, particle-in-cell simulations help reveal the splitting of the amplified seed as a result of resonance slipping induced by the large pump chirp. In addition, a new scheme for SRBS was proposed, Stimulated Raman Near-Back-Scattering (SRNBS), while using a three-wave model, in which, by varying the pulse-front tilt angle of the pump, the length of the pump beam passing a plasma can be controlled. As a result, this new scheme may efficiently enhance the amplification, and at the same time, it could reduce the spontaneous Raman radiation that may pre-deplete the pump pulse. Simulations using the three-wave model was also applied to better understand the novel double-pass SRBS experiments. Landau damping and the frequency shift of Langmuir waves were identified as possible reasons for the low efficiency of single-pass amplifiers. In the double-pass scheme, those problems can be alleviated, due to plasma cooling between the two passes.Ionization assisted self-guiding of very tightly focused beams for more than 30 Rayleigh lengths was demonstrated with the transmission up to 80%. A cylindrical shock wave is necessary for the self-guiding and it is generated following the expansion of the plasma filament created by a laser line focus. As an intense femtosecond laser pulse propagates inside the shock wave, a small portion of the pulse's leading edge ionizes the neutrals near the inner wall of the cylindrical shock wave. Such created free electrons form a guiding structure for the trailing part of the pulse, which could enhance some laser-plasma interactions, including the recombination X-ray lasers developing in our lab.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380940640uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp012n49t449703658nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100001600169245008300185260005800268300001100326500007800337500004200415500004500457502004800502506006700550506005900617520231900676710009202995773005103087793001203138856015003150856005603300AAI1380997620190916110847.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060384  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13809976  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12899  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aLi, Nannan.10aSimulations of Polymeric Nanoparticle Assembly Through Rapid Solvent Exchange. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a162 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Panagiotopoulos, Athanassios Z.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aStructured nanoparticles are important for various scientific and industrial applications. For example, Janus particles can act as pigments in electronic paper, interfacial stabilizers, optical probes and catalysts; core-shell particles are useful in drug delivery; patchy particles can self-assemble into hierarchical structures. These applications require nanoparticles with a narrow size and morphology distribution, which needs to be addressed by the fabrication methods. In addition, a method which is simple and scalable is also desirable in order to achieve commercial applications of the nanoparticles. Flash Nanoprecipitation (FNP), which involves the rapid mixing of polymers in solution with a miscible non-solvent, is a continuous and scalable process that offers independent control over nanoparticle size, morphology, and composition.To understand the assembly mechanism of FNP and to make quantitative predictions for experiments, I performed molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations. On the nanoscale, the MD simulations studied the assembly mechanism and revealed how nanoparticles with a range of surface structures, including Janus, core-shell and patchy, arise from different processing conditions. The simulations also indicated that nanoparticle morphologies and other properties such as the composition and patchiness can be reliably tuned. To reach macroscopic length- and time-scales, I performed KMC simulations and studied how nanoparticle size and size distribution can be controlled by processing parameters specific to FNP, such as the mixing rate and the feed concentration. The model produced results in quantitative agreement with experiments and also provided insights on particle aggregation mechanism through the solvent displacement process. This multi-scale simulation approach allows predictions for the FNP process from a given set of feed polymers and processing parameters. The results demonstrate that the process is highly promising for the production of structured nanoparticles with various surface features in a scalable and controlled way. These results also provide guidelines for future design and preparation of polymeric nanoparticles with desired properties using FNP techniques, and thus facilitate their applications in various areas.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Chemical and Biological Engineering)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1380997640uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01xw42nb70t03729nam a2200313   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100002300169245004600192260005800238300001100296500007800307500004200385500003500427502004800462506006900510506006700579506005900646520237600705710006503081773005103146793001203197856015003209856005603359AAI1381006720190916110847.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060391  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810067  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12900  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aChou, Winston Yan.10aEssays on Contemporary European Politics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a187 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Dancygier, Rafaela M.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item is not available from ProQuest Dissertations & Theses.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation collects four essays on transformative developments in contemporary European politics. These include the polarization of European party systems, exemplified by the rise of outsider parties at the fringes of the political spectrum; the loosening of traditional partisan bonds; the erosion of the political center; and social polarization, driven by the politicization of Europeanization, immigration, and national identity.The first essay, Bad Times or Bad Types?, examines the rise of the populist right in Europe through the prism of local politics in France. Examining a natural experiment involving wrongheaded financial decisions by local governments, it shows that populist voting can be a mechanism of elite accountability?albeit one that is imperfect and conditioned by access to information.The second essay, The Distortionary Effects of Turnout Inequality,  examines the implications of the political dealignment of working-class voters for electoral outcomes and party strategy in contemporary German politics. It questions the longstanding belief that turnout inequality?the lower propensity for younger, less-educated, and lower-income respondents to vote?systematically disadvantages Left parties. Drawing on an original survey and experiment, it shows that nonvoters in Germany are indeed poorer and less-educated than the electorate, but that they are also significantly more xenophobic than supporters of Left parties.Taking a broader view, the third essay, Party Strategy After Social Democracy, counterposes two explanations for the decline of Left parties in Western Europe. These include (1) steadily diverging preferences between the Left's two traditional constituencies, middle- and working-class voters; and (2) the strategic decision of many Left parties to moderate in order to pursue more middle-class voters. It amasses historical and contemporary survey evidence to show that the decline of Left parties is structural rather than strategic in nature.The dissertation closes with a fourth essay, Lying on Surveys. This essay is unique in that it is mainly a contribution to political methodology, albeit with an application to survey data from Europe. In this chapter, I develop new statistical tools for measuring misreporting on surveys and apply them to a survey experiment conducted among radical right voters in Germany.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Politics)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381006740uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01t722hc60v02741nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100001700169245009700186260005800283300001100341500007800352500004200430500002800472502004800500506005900548520150400607710007102111773005102182793001202233856015002245856005602395AAI1381007220190916110847.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060407  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810072  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12901  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aLow, Ryan J.10aTwo-Photon Imaging of Brain Regions in Fissures and Learning Manifolds from Neural Dynamics. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a214 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Tank, David W.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aProgress in systems neuroscience requires effective tools and techniques for probing neural circuits, and for analyzing the resulting data in ways that drive theoretical insight. This thesis consists of three parts, aimed broadly toward furthering the measurement and analysis of neural circuits. In the first part, we present methods for two-photon imaging of brain regions situated in deep fissures, enabling the use of cellular resolution optical tools for probing areas such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). We demonstrate recordings of population activity in the mPFC and grid cells in the MEC in behaving mice. In the second part, we present an optical approach for measuring dopaminergic input to the mPFC with high spatiotemporal resolution, which has not been feasible using traditional methods. We demonstrate recordings of mPFC dopamine signals in behaving mice, and present preliminary evidence for fine-scale heterogeneity across individual dopaminergic axons. In the third part, we present a new unsupervised learning algorithm for inferring underlying, nonlinear structure in neuronal population activity. We use this algorithm to characterize the geometric properties of hippocampal activity and their relationship to behavior. And, we propose a conceptual model explaining how neural coding and trial-to-trial variability both arise from movement along a low dimensional, nonlinear activity manifold, driven by internal cognitive processes.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Program in Neuroscience)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381007240uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01pg15bh69w03706nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100002500169245011800194260005800312300001100370500007800381500004200459500003200501502004800533506005900581520243300640710007403073773005103147793001203198856015003210856005603360AAI1381030920190916110847.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060421  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810309  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12902  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aPisano, Thomas John.10aConnectivity of the Posterior Cerebellum: Transsynaptic Viral Tracing with Light-Sheet Imaged Whole-Mouse Brains. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a194 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Wang, Samuel S.-H.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThe cerebellum is conserved across vertebrate evolution, representing a constant mammalian brain fraction. Classically, the cerebellum has been associated only with motor functions. However, the nonmotor role of the cerebellum has recently begun to attract greater attention; currently, its role in brain processing is poorly understood. Cerebellar disruption has consequences beyond motor coordination. Injuries to the posterior cerebellum produces a cognitive-affective syndrome characterized by nonmotor impairment in executive function and affect.The cerebellum receives substantial input from nonmotor cortical regions and projects back to the neocortex. Much evidence has come from neuroanatomical viral tracing studies in primates, suggesting polysynaptic loops join forebrain areas with the cerebellum. Enriched understanding of nonmotor cerebellar function can be achieved by identifying cerebellar polysynaptic connections to nonmotor neocortical areas. Anatomical studies of nonmotor cerebello-cortical loops are instructive of the cerebellum's role in cognition and affect-function derived from structure.Transsynaptic tracing, histology, and subsequent analysis have challenges including low detection signal, tissue sectioning damage, and biases from manual quantification and anatomical assignment cells. Primary contributions of the thesis involve combining viral tracing with histological techniques for automated quantification of transsynaptic connectivity. I have optimized tissue clearing techniques for detection of virally-infected cells, allowing for volumetric imaging of whole-mouse brains with light-sheet microscopy. Using computational alignment software, I can automatedly and reproducibly register brain volumes to an atlas, removing error-prone manual structure identification. I have generated a local atlas with a complete cerebellum, which maintains translatability with the field standard that lacks the posterior cerebellum. This approach serves as a template solution anatomical commutability across research groups. Using neural networks, we have developed a three-dimensional cell detection pipeline capable of efficiently and accurately detecting polysynaptic connectivity in large brain volumes. Using this pipeline, I present findings showing the cerebellum densely projects to and can influence nonmotor brain regions with functions typically associated with autism spectrum disorder.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Molecular Biology)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381030940uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01jq085n77b03716nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100001800169245012100187260005800308300001100366500007800377500004200455500003300497502004800530506006700578506005900645520237700704710006403081773005103145793001203196856015003208856005603358AAI1381032720190916110847.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060438  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810327  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12903  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aLiu, Guannan.14aThe Mechanical Basis of Myxococcus xanthus Self-organization and Motility: From Single Cells to Collective Behavior. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a156 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Shaevitz, Joshua W.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aMany living organisms exhibit complicated but highly organized collective behaviors. Unlike passive systems whose dynamics are driven by thermal energy, living organisms are often active systems, in which motilities of individuals put the system far away from equilibrium. Naturally living in soil, social bacteria Myxococcus xanthus exhibits a series of fascinating self-organizing behaviors throughout its developmental cycle, including swarming during vegetative growth, forming rippling waves during predation, and aggregating into fruiting bodies when starved. In this thesis, I use M. xanthus  as a model system and explore the mechanical basis behind its motility and self-organization. My work emphasizes on the utilization of microscopy, image processing techniques and data-driven analysis in the examination of  M. xanthus on different scales. We first study M. xanthus  fruiting body formation based on the statistical physics of active populations. We show that the aggregation process in M. xanthus resembles the dynamics of a spinodal decomposition phase separation. Modeling  M. xanthus as active brownian particles, we demonstrate that the phase separation can be understood in terms of cell density and the Peclet number that captures the cell motility regarding its speed and reversal frequency.  M. xanthus cells actively take advantage of their cellular control of motility to drive large scale aggregation by promoting gliding speed and suppressing reversals to increase motility persistence. Then we characterize the rippling behavior of M. xanthus both on single cell motility level and on population level. We find tracking data of single cells during rippling lacks the evidence to support the cell motion synchronization hypothesis. Using two different image processing techniques, we are able to characterize low density rippling structures by estimating local cell density. We further examine the high density rippling wave structures using a 3D laser microscope. Finally, we study the force generation mechanism of two distinct motility systems in M. xanthus. We find that cells use these motility systems in coordination while in groups. These results not only provided further understandings of the scale of forces M. xanthus experiences and exerts, but also suggests that M. xanthus mainly utilizes gliding motility during group migration.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Physics)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381032740uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01dz010s85303674nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100001800169245011600187260005800303300001100361500007800372500004200450500004500492502004800537506005900585520237900644710009203023773005103115793001203166856015003178856005603328AAI1381045520190916110847.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060445  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810455  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12904  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aHe, Xiaogang.10aDroughts and Floods in a Changing Environment Natural Influences, Human Interventions, and Policy Implications. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a229 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-11, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Sheffield, Justin;Wood, Eric F.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aHydrological extremes, in the form of droughts and floods, have huge impacts on a wide range of sectors including, most prominently, water availability, food security, and energy production, among others. The expectation of heightened drought and flood risk under climate change, coupled with burgeoning population growth and rapid economic development, poses unprecedented challenges for societies to boost resilience to these natural hazards, mitigate their extreme impact, and develop effective and actionable solutions towards sustainable development. The objective of this dissertation is to advance our understanding of these hydroclimate risks and their societal impact in a changing environment through a coupled human and natural system (CHANS).Chapter 2 and 3 diagnose the changing characteristics of droughts and floods from a climate perspective. Chapter 2 compiles the first Global Drought and Flood Catalogue (GDFC) to provide long-term, consistent and robust estimates of drought and flood hazards. This state-of-the-art catalogue acts as a basis for us to understand current risks and how they may change in the future. Based on GDFC, Chapter 3 develops a novel statistical framework to examine the often overlooked but important risk of coincident droughts and floods.Chapter 4 and 5 focus on the human dimension of the CHANS. Using a physical framework, Chapter 4 conducts attribution analysis to disentangle how climate variability and human interventions (e.g., water use, irrigation, reservoir operation) intensify or mitigate the recent California drought. Taking a further step, Chapter 5 aims to incorporate human behaviors and decisions?which are currently unrepresented?into a large-scale hydrological model to investigate how individuals' decisions and their behavioral heterogeneity affect the dynamics of the CHANS. Chapter 6 develops a hydro-economic model to identify possible solutions and optimal development pathways towards better management of water-related trade-offs (i.e., energy production and irrigation in California) and environmental sustainability (i.e., groundwater depletion).The integrated modeling platform developed in this thesis can be used to balance trade-offs among conflicting objectives and quantify the potential space for improving current water management strategies, especially under severe hydrological extremes.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-11B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381045540uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp019593tx92503566nam a2200289   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100001800169245011600187260005800303300001100361500007800372500004200450500003200492502004800524506005900572520230100631710007502932773005103007793001203058856015003070856005603220AAI1381097420190916110848.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060452  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13810974  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12905  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aGuo, Jinsong.10aKnowing Number: Mathematics, Astronomy, and the Changing Culture of Learning in Middle-Period China, 1100?1300. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a278 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: A.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Elman, Benjamin A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aThis dissertation seeks to integrate the history of mathematical knowledge in middle-period China with the history of its learned culture. It challenges the traditional historiographic image of Chinese mathematics and astronomy as socially and epistemically isolated enterprises, and argues that their significant development in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was in deep connection with the primary programs of learning for the literati and for those who aspired to become one of them?reading texts and comprehending tradition. In so doing, the study stresses the overlapping ventures of knowledge making under the broad rubric of ?number? (shu ?) and the communication between divergent intellectual groups in a time when the hierarchy of ?learning? (xue ?) was flexible and contestable.This dissertation is divided into two parts, each in turn consisting of two chapters in the form of case studies. Part I mainly focuses on mathematics in the Southern Song (1127?1279), highlighting the connected endeavors of mathematicians and literati in the making and application of numerical knowledge largely outside of state sponsorship or control. Part II turns to Chinese mathematical astronomy under the Mongol Empire (1206?1259) and the early Yuan dynasty (1271?1368), featuring a stronger presence of political power as well as cross-cultural elements.In the first part, chapter 1 analyzes and compares three Southern Song publishers of mathematical books, who belonged to divergent social groups of literati and practitioners but displayed parallel efforts to make mathematical knowledge more accessible through printed texts. Chapter 2 discusses literati scholars' and mathematicians' shared engagement with numerical problems related to milfoil divination and the Classic of Changes (Yijing ??).In the second part, chapter 3 looks into the uses of textual investigations in the calendar reform of the Yuan around 1280, highlighting the astronomers' precise choice of hermeneutical stance and its relation with contemporary classical scholarship. Chapter 4 examines the Chinese study of meridian differences in the Eurasian context and shows how contacts with Islamic knowledge brought about a new spatial as well as cultural awareness in the Chinese conception of astronomical knowledge.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Dept. of East Asian Studies)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10A.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381097440uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp015d86p301603237nam a2200301   4500001001200000005001700012008004100029020001800070035002400088035002800112040002900140100001400169245006000183260005800243300001100301500007800312500004200390500003000432502004800462506006700510506005900577520195900636710007102595773005102666793001202717856015002729856005602879AAI1381162620190916110848.5190916s2019    xx |||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9781392060469  a(MiAaPQ)AAI13811626  a(MiAaPQ)princeton:12906  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQdNjPdNjP1 aLy, Ryan.14aThe Role of the Pulvinar in Selective Visual Attention. 1aAnn Arbor : bProQuest Dissertations & Theses, c2019  a107 p.  aSource: Dissertations Abstracts International, Volume: 80-10, Section: B.  aPublisher info.: Dissertation/Thesis.  aAdvisor: Kastner, Sabine.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--Princeton University, 2019.  aThis item must not be added to any third party search indexes.  aThis item must not be sold to any third party vendors.  aOur visual system has a limited capacity to process the complex, cluttered environment around us. Information relevant to guiding our current behavior needs to be selectively enhanced. This process is known as selective visual attention. Lesion studies and electrophysiological recordings reveal a network of brain areas, including the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, that is important for visual attention. However, the role of the pulvinar in visual attention and how it interacts with other areas is poorly understood. To approach this problem, we first developed novel methods to to record neuronal activity from multiple subdivisions of the pulvinar in macaque monkeys using multi-electrode arrays while they performed a spatial attention task. During the period of the task when attention was maintained, spiking activity of putative inhibitory neurons in the pulvinar was suppressed, suggesting that attention operates through selective disinhibition of pulvinar relay cells. In addition, spikes from dorsal pulvinar neurons synchronized with the local field potential in the ventral pulvinar during attention, which suggests that the dorsal pulvinar and connected attentional control areas may bias early visual areas by modulating ventral pulvinar activity. Secondly, we identified low-dimensional structure in pulvinar population spiking activity that suggests oscillatory-like dynamics in spiking during sustained attention. Finally, we recorded neuronal activity simultaneously from the lateral pulvinar and two interconnected cortical areas and examined network interactions during attention. We found evidence suggesting that the pulvinar synchronizes oscillatory activity between cortical areas during attention and may also support sustained, elevated spiking activity in these areas. Together, these results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the thalamic and thalamo-cortical networks underlying selective visual attention.2 aPrinceton University.bUNKNOWN_DEPARTMENT(Program in Neuroscience)0 tDissertations Abstracts Internationalg80-10B.  aEnglish40uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:1381162640uhttp://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp011n79h7109
